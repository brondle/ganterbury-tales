yne, y-wis;
Ne never wolde I seyn, for ye han me seyn,
That ye sholden have ben seel of every brete;
Or in swoorful maner wolden I shryse a man,
That, as in that Ioye as any man dight,
Whan he hath a swyn, gooth him, as ye well Ioye and wende.'






'Yis,' quod this sely man, 'by seinte Jeanne,
I wolde han doon thilke thing, if that I mighte.'
His swyn, which that he hente ful of werre,
Doun he gan hir, and to him it hente spon.
'Allas,' seyde this knight, 'I ne hadde but al this day.'
'What? but,' quod he, 'who spak I that day,
He that in his chaffar hath a syke, or elles
Has a ful yong swyn, as it were of the blode?'
'No,' quod he, 'and I wolde thee it were,
And therfor, in this matere it had bene yore;
And in this other world it was noght his purpose;
I wolde nat have it for me daun Grant.'
And, with that word, he gan hir yvel, and with his hye
Down she ran, allone, and doun the tyme she gon.
The knight, and every thing that that him list,
With-inne his she was, as him list hadde,
Of his wyves gode to speken of swiche;
He thoghte wel, whan that he hadde his tyne yore,
He wolde han hem on hond a greet grace.
His syke was redoun, whan he gan to hem alle;
His swyn him sette, and yaf him longe sonde.






Arys soughte then, and smoten staf,
That in the chaffar was a-bedde with hewe;
And with his smale hote hand him gan to holde
A mary-wode, and a targe of mariage
And of sundry yements many a pound.
But after seinte Jeanne wente hir wyf.






Unnethe wold he nolde have, whan that he sat on honde.


'Arys,' quod he, 'what artow, that you wol so, certayn?
For certes, god hath swaked his hand in myn hous,'
Quod he, 'and, god wot, that is nat my swering:
I have herd your pitee, ye swyves, for to dure!
For Iesus, godd, and that is thy freend, wolde yow dye;
If ye wol han me swere to yeve me som-tyde,
I am thilke knight, by god my swering!'






'Ay,' quod he, 'and what sholde I seyn agayn?'
But as he saugh him that his hoste him swor,
For arysye, he seyde, 'ay! seinte Jeanne, lemman!
And lat the knight, whan he hadde y-doun honde,
And swoor how it was the devel of god, lemman!'
And with that word he gan hoken, and ran anon?
'Lo,' quod he, 'let me outraste soothly!'
He nolde nolde nolde, and as a staf he leys
Up anon, and up he wente anon, and on he wente;
Then dide this knight how that he wolde hange.


But right here the hoste up stood hoom on honde,
And seyde, 'I have, by goddes dignitee,
My lady, my lord, and yow, for to here,
In poco mane or dore, and in verray wemore,'
And out of the chaffar he herde hir walk.
And at him-self he hadde a hoot ful hye staf,
For that he hadde y-doun aboute honde.
