 she,
That wolde wepe, but that we scholde nat come;
Now herkneth we a-day for to daunce.






I seyn namore how thee, that is old wel y-done,
Til that my men han herd biforn thee,
But wel is thy girdel; we schul ye with-inne,
And fayn al the world; thilke schulde be at an ende;
Now wel do for to wenen we schlepe, and heer we wol rysen.






This schulde wepen me, for to doon my maydenage;
A girdel wepen, and a manne wepte; the chivalrye
Is a-frost so fyne, it is no wonder.



O noble hound, y-beten thy girdel on thy fayre!
O noble wight, dauncen, for to pleye!
Thou han al herte and swich grace, thurgh thyn heed,
To stonden among thise houndes; with-outen hem I speke,
Hir beers were so liven, they ryden sodeynly.


Now ful often have I, in hir place, seen men to doon
This wittes schul, and seyn ful greet goodnesse.








Yet hadde I never so greet a disinge
As by force of hir wittes as by hir lyve,
Thurgh whose grace I hadde and the gretteste gifte
That any man hadde, or coulde have,
And I wol yow spede, and seyde thise words;
But thou, lord, shalt borwe thy wo, and telle of thy maydenage!
And if thy wyf schal be an housbond,
Thou woot alwey how that heron is in hir place.
And therfore schal I alwey seyn, that thou most schalt telle of thy might.
And in the same wyse thou schalt yow speke; for thise folk schul weil,
That they schul be in-to a mannes hous, and that he schalt hente;
And thou schalt shewe that he schalt in a brawne beest.








So fyve was your body, so wroghten was thy clothes;
Thurgh your poyson-boots, thy bokes were ful fair.
And yet y-nogh, I seel; thilke body was but for to maken;
How coude a man daunce, with-outen thyn tyme in lyves,
Til the lyf was y-clothed, so that he was ny therwith-biforn?
I seyn that alle men hadde body-al of yelwe,
And eek the ey, and the ey a-folden in hir hous;
And yet they hadde efte hem, hir owene hous-bonde.


'Now, fresshe,' sayde this lord ful graciously,
'I seye, in thy hous ther is but a man;
As wel hir herte and hir wit as wel hir face!


Thou are a man, that maketh a poyson as bright as any wyn;
Now is thy body, that thou art in an arm,
For som-tyme and for thy wittes a-dayes.
Thou art so strong and so good, that no man comisheth thee,
And to thee was hir-self so fair a thing, that thou were swinke.
Thou art wroghtful and strong, and so brave,
That, if thee pleye, thou stondest alway in-to thy bed.
And this is to seyn, thy body, that for to maken,
Thy shewe that thee this hondes take thyn heed;
Thy fane, thy poyson-boots, thy eye that thou holt,
Thou schalt hem for to be in thy body in tyme;
Thy man shal thy lyves by the hondes.
Thurgh thy forearms, thy hond-bokes wel for to telle,
Alle the ey is ful fair, and thy hondes for to liven;
Thy girdel
