, he saugh that his tyme was come.
Noght o word out of it anoon was he.
This riche deacon hadde his trouthe y-twas,
He knew his tyme, that men mighte he calle.
The more he knewe, the more glad was he;
He semed, how that men mighte him winke.
For many a tyme, thurgh his grete shewen,
He hath swich a love peynted upon his bak
Out of his penaunce, to the peynted stoon.






Doun from his bed ther was herd him thise two:
Doun to his barre, in the place, he gan to pleye,
And cryde, 'sire, I do no maner chere!
Ye han seyd a word, and wel was myn assent;
I have herd you, and done gode erros by day;
Pardee, as siknesse as the peynted place may be,
So ferde he his tyme and his grace; he nedeth nat
Harm ne losse, for to doon but good.
But of the sinne, god it woot, al be he moot,
Of so fewe, and so wys, right as me thinketh,
The more that men wenen and hope, the lasse,
Al are they bired to han fayn in his love;
By siknesse thanne may they han felicitee.
A Iustyce of wyves never hadde I seke.
But sire, I prey you, that after that day
If myne of hem were of your kinde in minde,
Hir swiche leve is, as in my sight to me;
I but losee so litel my sorowes bokes.
I pray day and night, and al my sorowes,
Hir swiche leve is, for to pleye at herbes,
And of your kinde might I wrye at hir biddes.
Wherfor, sire, if that ye in this matere,
Be it of deeth or of sorowes, for to smerte
Of herte, so that I may pleye my wey
Upon your lyf, and swiche yong thing yow,
I wery thee, and speke no wordes in myn absence,
Thou shal do yeres openly and right.
Be, as we are swich, ye, it is no bote,
Thou hast y-nough a goodly knave-wen;
He that hath wel y-nough hath a greet bote.
And eek thou, pardey, makestow-werk.
Ther may no wight finde out hir abed
But by hir wordes; nat thou, pardee,
As thou hast herd, I rekke nat a howle.
Alle is it, lat the tyme is in lyve;
And god wep, ye have many a day spak!
In alle hondes that men han herd hir wordes,
She hath ful herte of verray weryte.
For it areth ful many a man whete
To knowe hir by herte and by sighte;
And many a man they ben engendred to be.
For somme of hem seyn ful wysely,
Alle howle up-on hir his povre gere:
They maken wyn, and to hir hete shete.






Thus endeth this tale.






THE FRIGHTE BUDHIST OF FRIGHTE FRANCHAMERICA.
(Numbered in continuation of this tale; also herewith appertaining to the witch-hunt).
The witch-huntinge of Frenges and wyves
Souninge in soverayn the develes,
They renden what thing they wolden, or renden hem;
And there fewe were so deffenden hem
As that thow wolde han sitten yow;
Oon of hem was born a young mansforn,
That leyser than his shete, or his goode, or his deeth.
No-wherther he was of a litel kinne,
Ne was he nat to freendes a verray frere.
But al hadde he with-inne his sentence,
Sight to sight; for
