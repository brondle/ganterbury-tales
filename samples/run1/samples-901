 lord.
And yet, my dere wel, I wol nat.
I have his Iew, for it wol nat faille.
He areth noght of thise falsnesse.
Thy wyf are oght swich a lechour as pis-sane.






Myn owene lord hath swich displesaunt me
That when I doghter was with his doghter;
She have I swich misednesse of swich hevinesse,
That by the swete word this heighe god of his grace
With whiche he wol ben warisshed eft-sones blythe,
And yelden it yammerously in hir lyf of me!
But that I shal abyde the heighe god
Of al this world, thurgh my verray repentance,
Taken verray worship of this Iuge god of armes,
And after mine owne purpos in dede
He sholde abyde, as fer as my lene was.






A! false god, false god! owen god?
Who is he? who is he? who is he?
He is my lord, and my fader, y-lyke.
For I am him-self ful wo: 'al peyne me
Of my worship;) it wol nat faille me;
And, by my feith, he wol my wrecched heve hem,
That in myn herte wol I dwelle hem-ward:
And, lo, here the wys of him-self, I rede,
That false god of hevene be my worship!
And I shal with you two been as yemen goon.'
That hir goode swowninge for to stonde,
This fals he took agayn, and swoughte herde;â€”
'I werk noght,' quod he, 'by my feith,
I wol my litel body be so dere,
That I shal been a pye in-feith, as wel
As ye;) the false god, dere god!
A! false god, false god! how may ye smyte?
Mochiteth nat, er thou goost to hevene,'
Seyde this false god, 'ye up stirken in the sky!
What? what is this, and why wryte thee?
What is the cause, and whiche god forsook of thee,
That thou, false god, in his owene dere,
Seyde thou thy fals aweyf as if it were truth?
Mochiteth nat, thise dere god forsook of thee;
Thou seist thou what is the matter, and heeldeth thee!
Much as I shal tellen al the cause why.






The cause is, that thou, false god, art of hevene up-on Iohn.
Iohn, who-so Iohn is, is dere in his heste
Aboute thise false god, and ther-out hath he slayn;
And ther-in is the fals estat of the frere
That is of ther noon, ther-in is the fecche-tyde.
And ther-out is the falsest gentil hewe Iye,
The gentil gentilesse, ther the falseste wrecche;
The falsest falsyce, ther-out is the fole cote;
The falsest falsyce ther-in is the wryfing;
The falsest falsyce a-two, ther-out is the mewel;
The falsest falsyce three, and eek the moot yerne,
The false god that wailleth alwey is yerne;
The falsest falsyce four, ther-out is the hepe;
Alle the falsest gentil, this false god me bithinke;
Of cheyned fals, ther is an oxythes folye.
The gentil god, that yit of hevene wol nat abregge,
Caste his werk in a folye, as he wol do;
His sheeld hir-self in a pryke, as he heeld his wyf.
Ther is no gentil so feemely in his sheeld,
That ther is no werkman so fals as this Iohn
To take of the deeth a false gentil knight, and a feend.
And therfore, Iohn, with-outen
