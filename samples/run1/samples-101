Tha nesbeth that he dooth the vene;
So the worlde may finde this to be his.
The pyeer which seith al this,
'In-to the vayne of hevene
It is a fad, it is a nede:
And sooth, that whan it come ne sodeke,
In al this ende of his deeth
He may beste take him thilke place.'
'Ye,' quod she, 'the vayne of hevene
Grete lyk to this, and doun is no cause
That you may finde this to be thy
Doghter sith I speke and am sure.
The worlde cannot yow sire so high a love
As to wrye and to stonde.
But if that thou doon, that I am thy knyf
And wille may he take the wyf,' quod he.
She seyde, 'and this wyf is nede,
And the worlde doth have a hondry for,
But sith that thou knowe it nedes ne seelen,
For to han al this love and to han al the bithnes
Of yourre peple, ne to have a yede.
But now fadest for al al thy love; and seye, nathelees,' quod she,
'I wol yeve of-a-thing al thyn nedes ;
It is ech mange and of the worlde.
And therefore I speke of this and the mone.'






And to stede in-to the hevene
That to this eek, that was in-to the warden,
Ne hadde his hevene, but for to have
A-leve him a hondry, and of hir love for to see
Whan that he was in the warden.
And so hadde he al this love
As though that he wolde yow aventure him, or were ye,
And sholde wende al-waes and al-waies
Of hir fades, and hir fades for to hear,
And hir sakes that he hadde wolde him in-to the warden.




'Ye,' quod she, 'are, whyl I noot of your sire;
Wes, what hath it been that ye speke?
Do thou knowest what this was that ye han from his father?
And wite that he was, that yow of you mighte:
It is an othere, the worlde doth have a sode.
The worlde sode is that it is neding.
And eek is that he ne hadde it in alle place.


Now, thou moste shal know I namly of hir,
And thou hast a sire that is ful hong.
And shal I finde this thing, or noght finde it?'
'No,' quod he, 'yet noghter be ye in-to the warden
With thy wyf than thou hast the love of man
That has done thee a-doun, or so that be
In thy body and in thy love, for to dide wyveste.'



'Hir yow are naught of this, thou hast nat al this.
Farewell; for the love of God,' quod she, 'are thilke.'
And soothly, she seyde, 'I will make my laddes wyf
For to han this love, that no wyve hath.'
And for to doon this, quod she,
'Of a y-sword, for to be sith as he shal be, I have nis
So wys as I am, ne mixt to be.
Hir lond is full of gold and of lond, and a-doun is full of sondrye.'
And she that was at hir peple said,
'But wol I sha'le and pryl the wyf?'




'As ye, if ye have the love of a gentil'
'Of a gentil', quod she; 'we, to whom alle is noce
But with-outene of hir body and in-to his love
Shal nat be his bithnes, with al his peple.
In truth, sire, and siree and siree, that we be a sondrye
