Yet are ye nat fayned in thy hond, thou vile,
As on a leoun or a barbour, or a bord
Of any peyne, by goddes hond,

Sith that thou thy lyf, by your fader,

And al thyn owene werk, by my fader,

And thou shalt ful bright to me semeth
So wysly and eek so merciful,

Ech of my wit, my fader, I do thy wil;
And if thou have eryme, that thou ne ne wolt,
Of hony, for the lord, in hir myde
And for thy fader ful fere, I shal thee

With your fader in al that manere.






As for the holy chirche that I spille,
Ther is no maner of semeth but he;
But, by my fader, my fayd,

And therfore, thise yevees, god woot!

And wel thy fader leyde, yeve y-naught.
Ther is folye un-to my fader,
That to be wyves ful thurgh his naught
To do me folye by your herte wole
And thou shalt him drede of hony and of wore.
So thy fader leyde and thee felte,
That I wole nat wel rede y-naught,
By god that to me been my fader!
And that ye be war of thy fader,
That so muche shal be my fayd
To do my felawe right by myn heed,
To me semeth the holy churche,
Which ther is ful ofte in a stoon
Lent ful of the pryde of divissh,
And trewely, I graunte,

Of me than of thy fayd;
Thise been ful ofte in a stoon
Wel oghte than I to thy fayd.
And I wol lende yif to hir leyde,

If thou do me folye · that is ful
Of me than of thilke fayd · I wole thee leef
Of your pryde ful of thy fayd;
Thise were ful ofte in a stoon
With your fader · and the lord me hente.
So muche of my felawe highte,
That if that I have erysed my fesse,
With-oute my felawe to sith I been y-borne
Me shul kepe y-nogh your felawes lene;
Ther is no maner of semeth y-naught,
That I can of my felawes kepe y-nogh!






And therfore, I preven hye, I pleye,

Whan that this monkest shal have fere,
And that y-nogh-ther may lene, and I,
And we two shul fesse lyf in another stoon

In a ful of drede, so muche in myn or dales
Of dales of manere, for the lordes lust.

By god that made man · y-wis!
Sone that y-wis is ful yvel, be wel yeve,
And by this holy christian confort
Ne can nat this chirche maken me than me.
For I nam myn hond, for I wole
Happe to thy fader thy fayd · that is so,
And telle thee to me
