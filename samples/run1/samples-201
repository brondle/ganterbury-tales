 light and stille
In heven al atte noon,
That with that swyden ful gret in the chyme,
The rose with swiche anoon a day!








Lo, by the comforaunce of May
She rometh so far and so danse
That al that Maye hir love so y-nys,
That they trode up on a moor-banke,
And with her levee, by goddes grace,
Fro day to day her rothe to bryde;
Her rothe had been fader of May Iore,
That fadres ne mighte hir fader rene.
Ther-withon she trowe, and leet her deeth,
And pleye faste al in the rut.
For she in hir right olde, wiste wel
The rose ful of the fader, and dide al.
And thenne, this noble Marte mayst thou live
Til the sesone that hadde his werre
In this rok, I seye it nat by hir shee.
And soon, that the day of his werre
Is come, his loyes ne preve,
To go the werk of May, by the fader.
And whan that thou art come to the fader,
Then shul that thou hast, in myn honour,
Fro Ioly May, with a yd for it
That I trow thee, and wol wende thee to do,
For thy dere love, this noble Marte, so greet!
Now wel, sir yow, with hir gentillesse,
Ye be my greet, and with hir wyse.
O noble Marte, I meane for-asye,
That fader hath been to thy werk and borwe,
Whan that thou seynest me alle, and thyn soule,
That yow ne have me in this lusty wo;
For, if so were, I knewe the falsly
Fro heven May, in that tyme that I hadde
Ioye to thee, as I have told yow here,
And made for to be y-born, by you;
And for the greves for the deeth that I han to do,
I wol in my halle be a pouder.
So greet was the lusty werre of wyne,
That y-clothed she hadde y-nough a wrye,
And she was a-crist for to lye, and for to blyse
As any of us, y-nough so that she never gan
Y-daunged in bord of the werre.
And thus my lord, god of my soule,
Was with his levee y-nough of May Iore,
And herneth right forth, as I gesse, as I here,
With-inne hir housbonde of al his lond,
Whan that we han dide al the dores
As we han everichon, and han a-doun
Of the courser, with-inne a deel of wyse.
And forth, o Lord, and in your grace
Bothe yow, and yow a-ridding, with god,
Thou hast brought the fairernesse of May
To this duk of werk, that she loved
With swiche ooth the moste that a womman may,
And was bred and han many a fader a frere;
And was with child of my dere yongnesse
With hir deeth, which that my fader of love
Hath taken me in his werk, in my fader
To be a pouder, for my love.
Fie in the fez as ever I may
That thou hast so fader, right anon
That, in my dere lond, I han me sworn,
To wol yeven the fairest of wommen to live,
Whilom that the Marte is come, and her
To come, and han in our werk, and to falle;
Fro day, and for the tyme my good fader
Caught hir in hote lyf, right before,
And after the rok of May, right a day,
As in the morning on my leves, for to wolde,
As it was right in the grete y-nogh wey,
As I be told, so that I seye, by
