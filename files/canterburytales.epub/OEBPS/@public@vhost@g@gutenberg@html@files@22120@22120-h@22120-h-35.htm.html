<p>Now I have aspyed · that freendes have I non.</p>
<p>Cursed mot he worthe · bothe fleisch and blood,</p>

editions will replace the previous one--the old editions<br/>will be renamed.<br/><br/>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no<br/>one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation<br/>(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without<br/>permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,<br/>set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to<br/>copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to<br/>protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project<br/>Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you<br/>charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you<br/>do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the<br/>rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose<br/>such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and<br/>research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do<br/>practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is<br/>subject to the trademark license, especially commercial<br/>redistribution.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*** START: FULL LICENSE ***<br/><br/>THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br/>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK<br/><br/>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free<br/>distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work<br/>(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project<br/>Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at<br/>http://gutenberg.org/license).<br/><br/><br/>Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm<br/>electronic works<br/><br/>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm<br/>electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to<br/>and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property<br/>(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all<br/>the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy<br/>all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.<br/>If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the<br/>terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or<br/>entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.<br/><br/>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be<br/>used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who<br/>agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few<br/>things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works<br/>even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See<br/>paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement<br/>and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic<br/>works.  See paragraph 1.E below.<br/><br/>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"<br/>or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the<br/>collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an<br/>individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are<br/>located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from<br/>copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative<br/>works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg<br/>are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by<br/>freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of<br/>this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with<br/>the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by<br/>keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.<br/><br/>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern<br/>what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in<br/>a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check<br/>the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement<br/>before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or<br/>creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project<br/>Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning<br/>the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United<br/>States.<br/><br/>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:<br/><br/>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate<br/>access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently<br/>whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which

for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with<br/>almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or<br/>re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included<br/>with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org<br/><br/>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived<br/>from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is<br/>posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied<br/>and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees<br/>or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work<br/>with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the<br/>work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1<br/>through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or<br/>1.E.9.<br/><br/>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted<br/>with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution<br/>must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional<br/>terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked<br/>to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the<br/>permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.<br/><br/>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm<br/>License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this<br/>work or any other work

work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other<br/>form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm<br/>License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.<br/><br/>1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,<br/>performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works<br/>unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.<br/><br/>1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing<br/>access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided<br/>that<br/><br/>- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from<br/>     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method<br/>     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is<br/>     owed to the owner of the

paid within 60 days following each date on which you<br/>     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax<br/>     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such

Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the<br/>Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.<br/><br/>1.F.<br/><br/>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable<br/>effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread<br/>public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm<br/>collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic<br/>works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain<br/>"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or<br/>corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual<br/>property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a<br/>computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by<br/>your

the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with<br/>your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with<br/>the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a<br/>refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity<br/>providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to<br/>receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy<br/>is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further<br/>opportunities to fix the problem.<br/><br/>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of

damages.<br/>If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the<br/>law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be<br/>interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by<br/>the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any<br/>provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.<br/><br/>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the<br/>trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone<br/>providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance<br/>with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,<br/>promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,<br/>harmless from all liability, costs
