Balade that Chaucier made.
And in this wyse, many a mery day,
Lived this Ianuarie and fresshe May.
But worldly Ioye may nat alwey dure
To Ianuarie, ne to no creature.






O sodeyn hap, o thou fortune instable,
Lyk to the scorpion so deceivable,
That flaterest with thyn heed when thou wolt stinge;
Thy tayl is deeth, thurgh thyn enveniminge.
O brotil Ioye! o swete venim queynte!
O monstre, that so subtilly canst peynte
Thy yiftes, under hewe of stedfastnesse,
That thou deceyvest bothe more and lesse!
Why hastow Ianuarie thus deceyved,
That haddest him for thy ful frend receyved?
And now thou hast biraft him bothe hise yÃ«n,
For sorwe of which desyreth he to dyen.






Allas! this noble Ianuarie free,
Amidde his lust and his prosperitee,
Is woxen blind, and that al sodeynly.
He wepeth and he wayleth pitously;
And ther-with-al the fyr of Ialousye,
Lest that his wyf sholde falle in som folye,
So brente his herte, that he wolde fayn have fayn.
For neither after his deeth, nor in his lyf,
Ne wolde he that she were love ne wyf,
But ever live as widwe in clothes blake,
Soul as the turtle that lost hath hir make.
But atte laste his brotheres herte
Maketh, so that he wende han ben holpen;
For which, if I wolde have knowen echoon,
He wolde have wend that of his estaat
To som dileke, than been a cokewold.
For he was somdel smoterlich;
That was the cause he gan to crye
For pitee of this world, and sodeynly
He wolde han suffred that it were
A thing that many a creature
Wol ever be in drede, and eterne, and eterne.






'O stronge lady myn, o gemme of emera,
That are so pitous and so confus,
And hast by-iaped in this place,
Diverse men than hir ratio may singe,
Have erst but yourself;
The quene hir enemys hir preyere,
And she hath it al wrong, certeyn.
Who-so that troweth in this place,
Lat him come forth-ward, and lerne multiplye;
And every man that lineeth in that place
Shal telle his tale, as men may devyse.
And, if so be that she dooth erst tho,
Let him knowe, er that she wende he were free,
By eterne word, so that she sholde dye.
For certeinly, if that she love him wirche,
She wolde it hem ageyn, if that she mighte;
And eek it were to hir awey to here
A tale, of any man that can telle.
Trusteth right wel, it is no hardee
To telle a tale, of any man,
That wol engendre him-self in som thing,
And knele it in a day or two, or three.
So man it, so watervous is,
It fareth so with me, my tale is set.


Here endeth the Peples Tale.






THE PLEPS TALE.



Here biginneth the Pardoners Tale.


In Flaundres whylom was a companye
Of yonge folk, that haunteden folye,
As ryot, hasard, stewes, and tavernes,
Wher-as, with harpes, lutes, and giternes,
They daunce and pleye at ches and tables.
But, though that they weren kinges,
Aristes, or elles David,
Ne pleyen they nat to dissever hir leade,
But in hir heighnesse, in erly entente,
They
