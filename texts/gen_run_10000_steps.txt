Balade that Chaucier made.


This world is now ful tikel, sikerly;
We breken it al to-morn as a shadwe;
And ech of us bicomen otheres brother,
And ech of us spinners, and we xens,
And gerlandes, bothe day and night,
And wayter pater-nails, and earthes
In general, so that ther shal bityde.
And whan that we hadde a certeyn day
Hem Clens were y-voyded, so wormes hede,
And many a mery hir salte teres speke,
Til day bigan to springe was accorde.
And in his herte somwhat he solas,
Til day bigan to springe grete mirours raines
In al thatl we can demen by our wit.
Tho bigan he day by his wonder-teres
The whyte sheep, that Wool in wizard was.)
Tho bigan he day by his sleighte
The whyte hare, and by the holy confort
The man, charles, and eek the halfway prince,
Conforten, and voyded hir together.
Thus started is this lineage;
Men may devyne and devyse al conseil.







And so bifel, that in the toun of Rome,
The statue of the mother of god,
With bowe in honde, as he had seyn,
And arwes in honured harnesses,
And eek hir lemman, and hir posse,
And alle hir rythes and hir fayres,
And how they shul seyn "allas!"
Now changes heer of ensamples many oon,
And many a newe markisesse,
That shapen with-outen any recche or stryf.
Thus quyte Iogenes, olde wronges,
Of ech estaat and rudenesse,
And of lichets, and of avoutryes,
Of regnes, of regnes duetees,
Of honurable wordes, and of charitablenesse,
Of markisesse, and of baudes po,
Of contractes, and of werkinges,
Of preestes, and of procuringes,
Of chirche-reves, and of chirche-pieces,
Of chirche-spe, and of chirche-trees,
Of contractes, and of werkinges,
And eek of other art of instrumentes,
And in what manere, by whiche instruments,
If any persone order, or any wight,
To doon a thing, or elles make another.
It is hard to seken of trouthe and gladnesse;
Boras, brydel, brydel-leves, and cote-armures;
Keminations, and kemes, and cloothes, and torets,
And eek the appendices and the foot-long stele;
The shap, ther- as is the shadwe of deeth;
The eres of mortels, and the eres of eels;
Poudres, and eek the foulnesse of it,
That dreynte cutteth cisouns
After gif, and rots, and furnishins;
toggle, and turnips, and cloothes of lye;
Cots, and dukes, and bateles ful of plate;
Reliks, and chiknes, and saveles,
And eek the guttes caroles, and the rectels,
That drenchen in the roof of the pyrie,
Into the moone, and the dores, and the spares,
And the mannes shoo, it is so lowe;
Noon hyer was the faile, ne noght the lowe.
Beth war, I pray yow hertely; for if she fare,
She shal wel knowe that right as she,
Sin that it is the beste reed,
She shal reherce wel half a gode ende.
And if so be the game wente aright,
She shal seye right sooth, what that herde is.
For wel she seith, right as she that misconceyveth,
She that misconceyveth som freend or two,
And cheats hir-self, she cI crye 'allas! that I was so longe ordained
To long apprenticeship in sinne and in meschance!'
Ther I was bred, taughte me that I be old
To sone rype, and bad my-self for to knete!
Yet hadde I never hard enough, certayn,
To garden in the morweninge,
For to goon to the nexte citee.
I have ther-with to done, I may nat longe tarie,
To garden up-on the grounde,
And maken of our covent firmes three.
And therfore, sire, trusteth right longe in my tonge,
That I shal doon, I wol rewe on Thursday.
And wel I woot, Sathanas, if I have it in my might,
I wol shal make hem good men to venge thee.'






'Nay, by my fader soule! that shal nat bityde,'
Quod the chanoun, 'he seyde himself, what sey he?
Think on God, that for us sone may singe;
Preye our sinful lyf, and please kepe
Our hethen shrift, and that is most important.
For if we be sory and repentant,
God may sende us yong benison to us for.'






'I have,' quod he, 'on yow so greet a routhe,
That I yow swere and plighte yow my trouthe,
That whan your city was ire,
I wolde have yeve hem half so greet a thrallesye
As hemp, or elles swote;
And for to han eek Ioye and gladnesse
Of hem that dwelten in your regne,
And in your companye, I wol nat seye.
For, god it woot, I saugh wel in your spirits
Ye woot why that I spak, for ay the telles that I
Eek shortened was my tale for to make short victorie,
And for to give yow brekinge in dede.
But o thing warne I yow; for, til deth to-kerve
My shete, I dyed my hyer brow.
Ye loken as a seke man, and drunken on Wednesday
Delyt for your preyeres, I rede,
And for your something, out of your regne I levue,
Which I have lifted up-on your heres above.
And, god it woot, I dide it in your presence,
And in your presence, freendly, I swere.'






You winne that auter, and thus quyte me,
Which proved my quyte instantly and unequivocally,
That I was fals and noght the reste;
And thus ye han my trouthe as wel as I,
Which is to seye the same, certes,
I winne the man, ther god yeve me good witnesse!
But al gode reste, I wol no lenger lette,
But hastily a messe was ther seyd;
And eek I winne the man, to-morwe I go.
I make avow to goddes eres two,
And to my nexte maister viripoten,
That I wol rolle hem in the glede,
And eek they in the clerkes shode.
For Iohn,' seyde Iohn, 'oftis whete,
To you sir Ote, cloth and fode,
And water to mixe, and wind to flye,
Som maister I wol bringe yow adoun;
And elles, bothe bally and otoronto,
I wol soupe and winde also,
Though that I be mery, I dar wel sayn;
And eek I wol doon a vengeance also,
And of myn offyce I wol bringe him adoun.
And sir Ote, be war of this,
And teche me of al this regne,
Or for our heer we wol oght engendraste.
And sir Ote, be war, for wel ye woot,
This regne is doon, our wille is now for to saile.
And for ye shul han losten hir mariage,
And to nat have maistrie of myn herte,
I rekke as doth the develCaunterbury with ful devout corage,
At night was come in-to that hostelrye
Wel nyne and twenty in a companye,
Of sondry folk, by aventure y-falle
In felawshipe, and pilgrims were they alle,
That toward Caunterbury wolden ryde;
The chambres and the stables weren wyde,
And wel we weren esed atte beste.
And shortly, whan the sonne was to reste,
So hadde I spoken with hem everichon,
That I was of hir felawshipe anon,
And made forward erly for to ryse,
To take our wey, ther as I yow devyse.






But natheles, whyl I have tyme and space,
Er that I ferther in this tale pace,
Me thinketh it acordaunt to resoun,
To telle yow al the condicioun
Of ech of hem, so as it semed me,
And whiche they weren, and of what degree;
And eek in what array that they were inne:
And at a knight than wol I first biginne.






A Knight ther was, and that a worthy man,
That fro the tyme that he first bigan
To ryden out, he loved chivalrye,
Trouthe and honour, fredom and curteisye.
Ful worthy was he in his lordes werre,
And therto hadde he riden many a game.
Ful ofte tyme he hadde gon
Toward the toun of Rome, wher he preysed,
And certeinly he hadde won his day.
Gret was his cost, and riche was his route,
And heigh was his dominacioun,
So that thecebo ful felingly him gan to crye
That he hadde gotten him yet a nobil knight,
Hatred even to desmeyn his lyf.
And shortly to the point right for to gon,
This knight is to lamenten alle the
Winneres, and to Chelmeys and to May,
And speke they of wyves that ben winne.
But what she wolde that he be,
Whan that she knew his conditione,
And knew his tyme, and was hir tydinges also,
And had kept him fro the regnes he faced,
That she wolde noght uplinguyse his cryes,
Ne knede him nat forgat, ne quitte him nat his lexis,
But she him advised, er that he wolde singe
This coronsel in his langage ageyn.






Thus ends my tale of Cupide,
Sin that I yow telle not eek in what wyse;
But wel I woot the rokkes been aweye,
And ther-to bely-nahshipe of al the route.






This princess of that May, that is so bright and shene,
Hath in-to hir armes lace, grete and smale,
With hir moder dere under his armes bone,
That of his heed at hautarde is set ful deep;
And by hir eres skin she ete the wyn.
Thus hath she don alle salutaciouns,
And hir array awey after hir degree,
For which she freyned hir housbond to laft
The regne of regne hem whyl he was in regne.






Allas! this thing or no? seyde she,
'Now certes, Alla, I knowe yow for thy smerte,
As I, that am dronke of the same wyn
As thow, have I shal seyd yow for thy ponderacioun,
That whyl I was on the londe a worm.
Of kings is tendrenesse in myn herte,
And myn herte has turned som-what against me;
As in effect, it maketh me that I am now
Dronken, that causeth drenching of myn herte.'






What sholde I more seyn, but this regne shewed me
That but Regne sheeldes mochil and particuler;
Sheeldes been the mouth of every crate;
And if ther dorste no man seyn wel bihinde,
Doth your herte to the pulpetCurteys he was, lowly, and servisable,
And carf biforn his fader at the table.






Somtyme, to shewen his subtiltee,
And for to telle his worthinesse,
And eek to telle his heigh wilfulnesse,
That is to seyn, no wil to doon that him oghte.
But nathelees, it happed, many day to seyn,
By oon assent of thise councilours,
That, save the wyf, oh world, whyl that she lived,
She sed was to hir lordes wit and his science;
And for to hir housbonde bad hir for to seyn
How he, That is god, wolde maken a creature
Of any creature, answeren him in his techinge.


'Ye, world,' quod he, 'apostrophe this;
My peple me constreyneth for to take
A wyf, and make of hem delyces;
And eek I make avow to goddes eres two,
To telle yow al the condicioun
Of ech of hem, so as it semed me,
And whiche they weren bothe good and happy.
But sire, by your leve, that am nat I.
For though I bireve I me on hond,
The sothe is that, of my soule and of my body,
Yet nedes moste I evermore repente
That I, that wol be unravellinge,
This is to seyn, that I can not repente
Of olde romanceres, which that lyen me and preye
That I, that am now knowe as looth.
But for as muche replepentsaunce
Of olde romances, so fare I;
I seye for me, a rethor oft be
For to repleken of olde tempers aferd.
What for me, a ryotour and not a wyf,
I stonde up-on my heed a day or tweye,
And catch a bretheren ale, by my fey!
But this is yet the beste game of alle,
That she, for whom they han this Iolitee,
Can hem ther-for as muche thank as me;
She woot namore of al this hote fare,
By God, than woot a cokkow or an hare!






But herkneth, y-wis, I yow forbede,
That for my science I wolde forlesbee;
For who-so speke of magices is oon,
As crake I many a whyle wyn and brandy,
And for to eaten strong drinkes atte beste
That pleasyne and fel, and make me hackle and hete,
And make me belle hem, and kepe hem wel;
And I wol doon hem also, by my fay;
God help me so, I wol nat lye.'






Cecile answerde anon right in this wyse,
'If that yow list, the angel shul ye see,
So that ye uppon dayes three dayes and sho.'
And right thus she seyde to him that night
'This is my wyf,' quod she, 'that shal be myn.'
And right anon the nighteple it chaungede,
And every wight gan his tente goon,
And neatly he syde up-on his wyf.
And whan that he made hir atte laste,
Him thoughte how that the angel him had seyn
Of Selmoe, and of his progenie,
And of his hye temporel good,
And of his harpe well wroot, that it queynte;
And eek it snore up-on hir eke,
As smale as apple dooth in the lengthe;
So semed it to harpe and perfonse
As wel as it were the nightingale,
That tel elm, birch, plane, ash, and eek water;
Ther-for whyl that I saugh hem dragoun,
I sey nat that they been wont for to doon,
But that they rather singen,
That hir styl eek is set in siker,
For which they doon in full repentance;
And eek seydeGinglen in a whistling wind as clere,
And eek as loude as dooth the chapel-belle,
Ther as this lord was keper of the celle.
The reule of seint Maure or of seint Beneit,
By-cause that it was old and som-del streit,
This ilke monk leyde the keye of his celle,
And wente his wey, no lenger wolde he byde.






Sone after gon, how that a vanitee
Wolde hir privetee allone, telle hem this tale,
And eek bake hir soules, so she wolde preche,
And wel affer the macerye of hir professione,
Til dayes foure or three dayes atte leste
Y-passed been; than lat hir go to feste and pleye.
The fourthe day compleet fro noon to noon,
Whan that the heighe masse was y-doon,
In halle sit this Ianuarie, and May
As fresh as is the brighte someres day.
And so bifel, how that this gode man
Remembred him upon this Damian,
And seyde, 'Seinte Marie! how may this be,
That Damian entendeth nat to me?
Is he ay syk, or how may this bityde?'
His squyeres, whiche that stoden ther bisyde,
Excused him by-cause of his siknesse,
Which letted him to doon his bisinesse;
Noon other cause mighte make him tarie.






'That me forthinketh,' quod this Ianuarie,
'He is a gentil squyer, by my trouthe!
If that he deyde, it were harm and routhe;
He is as wys, nat to seye I smale,
As any man I woot of his degree;
And ther-to manly and eek servisable,
And for to been a thrifty man right able
To doon any lovere that a man may bespe.
But so bifel, so god me save,
So that I shal lede him in merry penaunce,
So jolly a creature, and so fel,
That ech of hem hadde maad been worth bord,
And thanne lyth in-to prisoun
Til that he, Melibee, be quit fro that place.
But by his beddes syde Damian,
For al his pompe and al his might,
I wolde nat sette him in heigh degree,
Ne abyden him to doon a thing that he mighte nat here;
And therefore I charge thee, to whom that he brak
This false knight, to telle his aventure,
And eek to faine him of that art,
That Thomson is set in heigh degree.
Ther hadde Thomson (and Ypres)
Til 1869, that the lord gan slepe;
He wente him-self in-to the feeldes,
And geten him som mete and som drink · of a Iubbe,
That somethe hath desyren that he
Doth this false knight to hinder his waywardnesse,
I rede thee, wyf, eek crye hem not to ado;
He is weren a man of weping and washing his tonge,
And it is greet harm and, certes, gret pitee,
To sette him in heigh degree.






Therwith he. I rede thee, if that thou wolt scole,
The botel by the weye · and water ther-inne;
And the hors of bras · love it weel;
And the pudding is doon on a mix of alle goode,
And ther-al come to lyth a levene · awey the prene,
And Venus warm wex thou hast in thy minde;
Mars is pale, and Mars is wan; Venus is conqure.'






Whan that my tale is ended · and Iesu Crist us sende
A cande of deeth for his privee sinnes · to Saluce;
Adoun he gooth, no lenger wolde he lette,
But hastily a messe was ther seyd · faste with-alle
Of alle the harmes that he coulde doon day or two,
And eek the goodes that he couldAcorded nat, as by his facultee,
To have with seke lazars aqueyntaunce.
It am nat honest, it may nat avaunce
For to delen with no swich poraille,
But al with riche and sellers of vitaille.
And over-al, ther as profit sholde aryse,
Curteys he was, and lowly of servyse.
Ther nas no man no-wher so vertuous.
He was the beste beggere in his hous;
252 b
252 c
Noon of his bretheren cam ther in his haunt;]
For thogh a widwe hadde noght a sho,
So plesaunt was his "In principio,"
Yet wolde he have a ferthing;
His purchas was wel bettre than his lord.
And rage he coude, as it were right;
And, for no thing but for his chivalrye,
He coude swich detracten it as him leste.
Ful riche he was astored prively,
His lord wel coude he plesen subtilly,
And je pense to knowe aught of al.
And rage he coude thanne on his flatereres,
And spoil his offring in a litel space.
But though that he were riche, and unlikely,
Yet coude he in a situation perceive,
And atte laste with pitous herte he shewe
His los of gold, and also his privele pley.






This pardonce, and eek the goode wordes
That we haveode in this place,
Whan we han herd the tale, lordinges, and sentence,
Consideringe the tale of Absolon,
That taughte us the grete rokkes hepe,
And also the grete honour
That he was to have at his bord his heed.
This worthy knight a doghter hadde he
Al were it only meke and tedious;
And god forbede that it were true!
But, whan it was day, this knight
Up-on a day, whan him liste pleye,
This olde Creon, cursed for hete,
Bad hir for to wepe and wratthe,
And seyde, 'allas! o tendre lord,
Is come in the Iape un-to the world adoun?
Is ther no ship, flye, or anything else,
That Iivar or Pertelote shal myn escort
Hadde this washed sailor, er this,
As he fled is, with his eres alle?
And for my trouthe, Iite, and light,
Nought helpeth us with our labour;
And god save al our labour! teche me ease,
As beste is my brother; for love is out of mesure.'






This Absolon for-dural answerde,
And seyde thus, 'what? telleth me honestly.'






'Have heer my trouthe,' quod she, 'Alee, by my fey!'
And wente hir wey forth, no lenger wolde she lette,
And cast eek hir fader ful erly in helle,
And in the see he dreynte for vengeance;
And she obeyeth to that fact with al hir might.
O blisful Thomas, ful of blossoming in your contree,
Here may men seen your persone as he goth in-to thyn herte.






This olde Creon, cursed for his sinne,
Hath hir-self hid in privetee,
Wher-as he loveth you, Iesioun!
Noght of hisee may we take your screen;
He hath thoughte so, pardee, so rough is his reyne.
And sith she is of hir tayl un-to the stake,
Of which the screen also; I may nat telle wher it lay.
But sooth is this, how that this pardoner,
That boghte hir sones in the televisoun,
Hath hir sones sote in-to the furie,
And eek in to the water jugged ther-biforn;
And for they were forged with stikkes and knyves,
In heigh maner strokes on hir helmes!
Thus hir sones in holinesse · and now they eschee,
And eek hirOf fees and robes hadde he many oon.
For out of toune was goon away to-morwe at night,
And broghte him in the nexte constable,
That every frere ryde and gooth hir way.






'Doghter,' quod he, 'allas! your labour is in!
I saugh yow noght this fourtenight or more.'
'Doghter,' quod she, 'god yeve yow my soule reste!
As I type, god yeve yow my body hardy!
I telle yow wel, manhede is a thing
Men may nat doon but-if they wol han cryinge.'






'Allas,' quod he, 'a fair womman was ther
Among hem, and greet and heigh health;
And by hir body, match made we;
She was ther-to come of Linne,
And swoor, and seyde, 'freend, I uthe,
A fewe freres han thee truste inyng,
And eek hir conseil goode and heigh,
And for to been in heigh estaat
Of honour, she was to me right lief
To liven in conservacioun
Of these fourten, and in vertu and in gentillesse;
And by hir body, seyde she,
'My conseil is good, god help me so.'






'Now, by your leve, o dere brother,' quod this Frere,
'Chydeth him weel, for seint Paul!
Te deod he me, what wol ye do ther-with?'






'By god,' quod she, 'I wol nat lye;
I shoulde rather lye
Than in inquiring of contemplacioun,
If that men axed him in certeyn speche;
For conversacioun is short, I candide,
And right as reson is, so kepeth it er this.
It may be shapen with candel-light,
And leyde on the reeb, and vanity,
And richardshipes, and lordshipees,
And affectiones, and lovees, and housbondes,
And also the condicioun of a wyf;
Thus made it the endyte hem nede.






What nedeth it to serven him to affirme
That never-mo ne shal be lost, that is sooth,
And that a cloisterer, or a wyf,
Or a paramour, or a love-chanterere
Shal be trewe y-nough, to benken sore
Of hir hevy thoghtres and hir bigyle.
But men seyn, it is greet harm and greet mescheef.
To dyen in-to honestee,
And thanne to be wedded, now certes,
It lyth nat in my tonge, nin my conning;
I take but the salvacioun of Ire and of Glen.
Perspectus patronus is early,
And many a seint, that writen with the wheel hem in,
He rolleth up-on the stepes grene,
And seyde, 'he loved me yet a del;
Now help, with alle diligence, to-morwe I wol abyde.'
The thridde Ioye of this is, that I dar nat undertake
To doon that she wol, certayn, er she gooth.
I moot do no sinne, myself, for she gooth;
But she prayeth me, mark, be ther-inne some privetee
To take of hir, and for us to glade and liven,
And eek to liven, if she my privetee may skepe.
My wyf and eek my mayde, and my wyf,
Han al crowneth in sikernesse;
And over hem shal I liberte hem of alle vyces,
Custance, and alle the remenants of myne enemys.
And over hir shal I han liberty of love,
And swoor, that I may been out of this care in yvolution,
When that her liste list to ryse agayn the peple.
For though I be old, and may nat see,
I knit together our chaffare, my wyf, in our wood.
A Shipman was ther, woning fer by weste:
For aught I woot, he was of Dertemouthe.
He was tall for a Pardoner,
And bred som-tyme of pigeons,
And skin of rainbows, and eek of lusty fetheres,
That causeth Alisoun to singe,
And cause why; it is no doute.
Ful sooth is this, how that this pardoner
Y-knowe, and why he was siker of hir livinge,
And eek of hir bednesse, and that is World-Soul.
But al-be-it so, his wyf was som-del deef,
And som-tyme temporel thinges of which I tolde,
Sin that hir housbondes lovede hir whyl he lived,
And fedde hir sometimes with preestes swete;
And eek, when hem lyked other for to pleye,
They tolde hir what they wolde han seyn,
And why she was out of hir lyves swayne.






YSELEWINE AND HIS PROLOGUE.



The Prologe of the Henryknes Tale.








This innocent theef, that gangrene he
Of Inuidia, as the book seith,
In guerdon of virginitee;
But for to telle yow al hir savacioun,
And eek to telle yow hir coveitise,
And if that she sinke of that care,
Or seyde, to what bityde,
She was so plesaunt uncouthe and reste,
That what man that was, or what povre was she,
She wolde eek quyte him in hir officeremone
Whan that she comen was in-to the feeldes served.






And for to make it straunge, she so longe
Encressed, that woodnesse out of hir herte she wolde go.
'Allas!' quod she, 'henges! what wol ye do ther-with?'






'Ther-of,' quod he, 'be as be may; sey ye,
Help us, sith it may bettre be;
I smelle a loller in the wind,' quod she,
'So lowe for to speke of kayn, I yow preye.'






'Ye, maister,' quod he, 'and here I go;
Up peyne of deeth, so ye may be war and wyde;
I make peyne for to swepe yow wel and bigyle.
Telleth your grief, so that men may sey yow good
Of that I have maad som-what in myn hond.
For, maister, by your leve,
I may yow laughe and carpe in a-night,
And eek I make vivid sounes and meninges,
So that ye offre nobles or sterlinges,
Or elles gold, that is but what it taketh;
And here I swere it is by my fey.'






'Now, sire,' quod she, 'I swere it for my-self,
But I mot thinke a mery tale or two,
Or elles I mot telle a legende
Of somone else, so dere is me to pleye.'






'Now, sire,' quod he, 'I wol appointe
A lineage of readers, mo than dooth a bille;
And whan that lineage is old as is,
I wol yow telle a tale or two,
Of an old serapion, I woot wel now
How that it shal been amended! for which I —
This same night — god help me so,
Though that it be the nones, it is pryme!'


So longe answerde she of this fox,
That prively hadde domesticated
The carpenteres wight, and of his sex also,
And thus she hath hir housbonde falle,
In al the reme of Finland:
And thus, ther is na-more to seye,
But conclude that this lineage
Shal forever more closely associate
With Emelye, than any female
Which that she coude or was, or satte yet
; and thus hir housbonde Emelye
HWithouten other companye in youthe;
But therof nedeth nat to speke as nouthe.
For somme of hem shewen hir heres in the toute,
Whan they were wont to goon in-to the toun,
With tonge unlordinge that they were wont to londe.






The elles of the tour, again,
Were daily busily sadned for to include,
And daily chaunged for to make mention
Of hir yonge maydens, that lay y-lore,
And busily they preisen hir reverence.
O creature! what mighte a man or womman bireve
Somwhat of business in his tyme?
Business! business! business!
The noon of seint Paul the apostle? Seint Paul! Seint Paul!
Thy freendes, be they whiche that stooden here,
Seyn that the feend hasteth hem in despyt,
And hasteth hem-self in routhe;
And eek I preye hem that they understande.
For if they wole trete of pees and of wo,
Ther is noon other wey but cheerleadinge
Of peple, that they mowe geten him what rowne they may seyn
By heigh salvacion, thanne are they slayn.



116 Ioye thus by thise oldee wyse;
For wel ye woot that emotional distress
Ther may no tonge expresse in no science;
And conne forth your wey, by your leyser,
Of him that is the semelieste in excesse;
And lo, what seith seint Paul in this matere:
"An emperour is he that delyteth him-self."
And wel ye woot that this same Paul is
In especial wise, this Paul in conseil
Of kings, princes, and women wondringe
In heigh and low, and that is to seyn,
And swoor he wolde been hir owne page;
Acquiteth that he seith it was no nay
To stonden in his regne or in his rente.


For right as men seyn, that it aperteneth
To hyden a storie, right so fare I;
Glose who-so wole a regne or a
Wode, right so wol I tellen of my tale.






Ther is, in rente, in middle of rallene,
Windom, that is ful lowe up-on the mone;
And ever in oon so gret was the shour,
That dyversly wente and so hir herte lighte,
That in hir left hande she mighte hir have bothe,
And made hir in-to sad wyse what she wolde seye.






'O doghter myn, Mars,' quod she,
'How shal I thee forfeyned have in pleyn
The yonge folk of myn allevacioun?
It is their soules answere, by my soun!
Allas! that I was wroght! how shal I wreke
The hele of my body, which that I have loved so
For verray shame, and of my-self ben tene.
How shal I been away on- lyk a day or two,
To walke, as Ielous as a tare,
And atte laste hir vanitee shal I seyn?
For yet, Mars, by thy corpus,
Thou shalt be deed, so atte laste thou shalt suffre.'






'O lengy god,' quod he, 'if it may suffyse
To me, that is wood, and hear my voice,
I wol erly answere it day by day.'






'What, wood-hewes, syk and sore,
Is this thing displese? telleth me plainly.'






'Now, wood-hewes,' quod he, 'I wol answere it neer,
And seye purpos and answere bottes,
That Barbarye, and eek thynalus,
And eek thyn Appule, shul ye have maistrye
Agayn the werkman billon, and that is animé
And rapport of every degree, I undertake,
Were it as whyt as is a lily-flour,
God loved he best with al his hole herte
At alle tymes, thogh him gamed or smerte,
And thanne his neighebour right as him-selve.
For trusteth wel, he that precheth to hem that tuneth,
He hath seyn ful many a seel and a rhyme.
Let wommen beware, this Talisse!
They liven alle, and levys alle,
And singe "allas" and "weylawey,
That I was born," but if it be
That I wil reherce a verse from his book.
Go, I wol nat lye, I sey for me,
Yet eft-sones how I lere,
Though that he loke never so gay a wyf.
This maxim may be preved by another,
But sooth is this, how that he, Marye,
And Thopas, and eek Arcite,
And eek many another blisful similitude,
That wolde han wit, but they weren kembd;
They goten heigh witnesse, but nat high degree.






Lo, Iesu Crist, of his mercy so gide;
For in this world certes, so worshipful aiffte,
Til deth was fly unto his deeth, allas!
So preyde he his neighebores, so longe preyde he hem emaile,
That whylom weren of philosophres fayre,
And wonder prively was he cleped Irascimini.
Save al this world, god so wis be my soule,
I owe nat al my lyf to no creature.


Noght schal I entirely bareyne
Of al my clothing, nor of my things,
As clerkes, for al hir beautee,
I have relikes which to my tonge.
For wel I woot, no man ne truste me
In no regne, but I am al redy here.
I am a man of litel sustenaunce,
And my tonge is longe, so whyte I wenche.
By god, I have the beste shoppinges
Of any man that liveth egre and smale;
I do no fors the toun of myn hous to conserve.
But sooth is seyd, brokkinge is in your shete;
I have the beste shetes and the stree,
And for sothe, they ben gode and eek profitable.
For gentil text can I noght telle,
But ther I lete hem werken in hir mindse
In general, so as whyl I have a lyte werk.
For civilios et denominos wol I telle;
Turbo, they wol I chaast by rekeninge.
And eek I seye, they liven alle up and doun
Of any ordre, so that the ordre or ordinance
Wol chaunge, if I be hood, for seinte Marie!
The remenant of the tale if ye wol here;
It dooth me no fors to tellen of my thoght
To no wight,rokke, or nightingale,
That hath but om despyt, to here;
But Venus is so lord and so grateful
Unto hir waking, every day she sun.
And so bifel that, if that Venus were naked,
She wolde goose, for indigence and for love.
And for that every wight hath this merveyle,
On every wight Mercury wore a wyte,
To make hir ful ofte a propre womman.
And so bifel, that, if that Venus were pale
And bald, and shy of corage,
And eek hir eyen greye as glas,
And sikerly she hadde a cuntree
Of peple, and she eek a mone,
And on hir fingers right of hir heed,
A rokken burly tree, as in good art,
Y-pressed wel, and cut with a ladde;
Hir flesh was rawe, and as an hunte
She bar armes two, hir flesh eatinge;
Now, god help, how longe she swoodde!
Thise tree ther-upon was bark;
Tho fond the tree, and did ther-her-noght.
Biforn the tree ther stood a cart,
In which ther dwelten kingThat he ne knew his sleighte and his covyne;
They were adrad of him, as of the deeth.
For him of wepinge made him bounde,
That never in al his lyf he, day ne night,
Used ne his lyf for elsewhere;
For she kepte it so clene and stable;
And eek it was he by mesure,
For in his bed he rood up and doun,
So as it were a spade.






And for ther is no tonge that it telle,
But hilles and biores riden,
The which he connection wolde han with ech degree,
And than with greyn he made it swal.


And eek therto he made it swal more hye,
By almesudinge of clothing,
And by augmentation of feeldes on hir part;
For which in no manere, though he adden hem two,
His vertu rente and his charge him royally.


Amonges othere thinges he maistow chese,
How he durste his wyf wil the contrarie,
And why she was wroght so heigh a wyf
In al the reme of al hir toune.






'Lo, so brouke I my peple,' quod she,
'This is a long preamble of a tale!'
And ther-with-al aboute hir swoor she,
'This is theffect and ende of my tale.






The morning dide Hester of pitee,
'Arveragus, myn hoste lief and dere,
Yif me my love, er that I fro thee wente,
I rede that we make, er we goon,
A long tale for to touche, I wol saye here.'






'Nay,' quod this monk, 'I have no maistrie
But if it were only a wyf,
Of which I brouke so greet a wyf,
With curteys shete and heigh prudence,
And if it were som soul perdurable,
Then sholde it thanke God and yif me
Much-needed in his tercia reason.
Som liste nat understonde how that a day
A wyf solas hire hir housbonde;
And eek I only rewe yesterday I 96
And spak of lampe, as I newe in omnia:
"With curteys shete, thou art a fool";
For whylom wise was she,
And lyk a tare, and liveth agayn in prisoun
With Iohn the clerk, that waked hadde al night.
She kepte oathes, and kepte vigil at hir wille,
That to no wight she wolde attayne
For hir housbonde lovede, by him to-scuro;
And thus, by oon assent, thus she seyde,
"Of that water, if that it be your wille?'






'Ye,' quod the clerk, 'sir, it wol nat be so.
Theon thing that I hope, paraventure,
Is that toyoun, by your longe deliberacioun,
Sin that I can not atteyne the cas
Of why I suppose, it is no fruit of vyce;
For certeinly, of his blisful goodnesse,
That I and other folk shul us han y-knowe,
Whan that the knowse is doon up-on hir heed.
For soothly, of hye Ioye that is engendred
In wommans minde, that whylom was she bore
On heigh Cadme, in ful beste wyse,
That if that she wolde longe abyde,
She sholde it quyte with a pin.
And, for ye shul seen heer, this is my plea;
I relesse now that I may been off fro yare,
And prively bringe yow a Carbuncle,
That by the force of hym y-bounde is;
And eek a bernes clene, and a targe;
And eek a mantelet on the wal,
And eek a cavalche, and eek a battle flage;
And, for that men moten make sport
Of knightes especially, it is no fruit of me.
For wel I wootThis pardoner hadde heer as yelow as wex,
But smothe it heng, as dooth a strike of flex;
By ounces henge his lokkes that he hadde,
And ther-with he his shuldres overspradde;
But thinne it lay, by colpons oon and oon;
But hood, for Iolitee, ne wered he noon,
For it was trussed up in his walet.
Him thoughte, he rood al of the newe Iet;
Dischevele, save his cappe, he rood al bare.
Swiche glaringe eyen hadde he as an hare.
So greet a glare hadde he as an hare,
It semed that he made the animals say,
That he was bistoor until they came there;
For which yet theyaiven him hood, for seinte Marie!
Him thoughte, he rood al bareyn,
And smale y-nough with his legges anyway,
And sente hir lettres teres in his gere,
That she and eek hir respect ne wolde nat vanish,
Ne make no overtures, till to purpos bifore;
Save that, if she livede as stille as stree,
She wolde it kill. / And for to make hir bold,
He hadde a night visione,
As wisly as god hath cast a dede,
He seyde, 'allas! my peple, I have mislay
My sone, and thus I have put me to sowe.
Now wolde god, that it were woxen night,
And that the night wolde lasten evermo.
I have mislay my sone, and so have eke many mo.' /

Lo, here our narrator; right after this bata
So biforn, the Pardoner answerde,
And seyde, 'heer shal we sowen som newe quene.
Som frere, that hath maad this world in hop,
Soms olde matures he to soweth newe chirche,
And eek his langour in descendinge.
He maketh tomberes, engendrles, and honours,
And turneth back to thilke land of origin;
For which his herte is set so in the eres,
That nedes moste twinne up and doun,
And eek he rolleth in-to the sheres,
And softely it is gladsom and grene,
And lyk a gras-tyme for to see.
A theef of engendrure, that hath it dere a-boght,
He rolleth up, and swoor it nsrely,
And seyde, 'mashire, I do no fors of deeth;
I thoghte, I wolde sette hir deeth
On my flesh, so that her soule glade.
For sothe, I wol nat engendre hem noght.
 For yet me greveth, I wol ben atte laste,
And engendre hem noght, bothe in engendrure
And shal han my flesh in engendrure;
And in the name of Crist I may be gay.
Comth sely Maria, and with hir mayde
Rominge in the ram shal I soon biholde;
And Jennur maye in vestibulo be
Wedded with sugre, and nat with greyn of Portingale.
Yet gonee I for to ferme another nutene;
For wel I woot, deep was the service caas,
And alle the ameniaries wyde.
Gret was the faire, and wel to sea-kayn,
And for to seke is bothe yong and old
With blak, unlyk the remenant of his care.
And shortly, from a sothe, ther lakked him
Noght but oonly a canlock,
That carted was ful of bones, out of alle shippes.
Ful prively ther stood him a wyf,
Of whiche that Iosele nuthe and wel coude,
And eek hir yonge suster Emelye.
And thus, with face pale of drede,
She behwed hir housbonde as he were wood;
And for the verray peyne he quookHere in this tale, as that they sholde stonde;
My wit is short, ye may wel understonde.






Greet chere made our hoste us everichon,
And to the soper sette he us anon;
And served us with vitaille at the beste.
Strong was the wyn, and wel to drinke us leste.
A semely man our hoste was with-outen
For to han been a marshal in an houre;
A large man he was with eyen stepe,
A fairer burgeys is ther noon in Chepe:
Bold of his speche, and wys, and wel y-taught,
And of manhod him lakkede right naught.
Eek therto he was right a mery man,
And after soper pleyen he bigan,
And spak of mirthe amonges othere thinges,
Whan that we hadde maad our rekeninges;
And seyde thus: 'Now, lordinges, trewely,
Ye been to me right welcome hertely:
For by my trouthe, if that I shal nat lye,
I ne saugh this yeer so mery a companye
At ones in this herberwe as is now.
Fayn wolde I doon yow privé,
And sey yow thus, how that I, Aurelius,
Had goon biforn this woman doun fer fro the Burton,
And seyde to hir gentil knight,
"Thou art a moche fool, tho!"
And for that she ferde over his herte a mantle,
And gear him for to killn himself at the gaudes of seinte Anne.
Gret was our soper for to here hem leel,
And for to doon hem al the confort that we can.
And ther we elwe first, on hors,
And than our hoste rood up-on a tree.






This messager, to telle yow al hir beautee,
As he were wood, and as a nightingale,
With hioun smale rimstones of gold stood y-do;
Shynen roundeles, as they were whan they were maked,
And rounde they were, and as they were seyn,
Great gret moyste in the relikes grene.
Ther nas no man in al this ground that him servyse
That he ne loved, that is to seyn, in monstroit,
Withouten other companye in youthe;
And so bifel, that to the tree he wente
Whan that he saugh that it was Dorigen,
Atiners, fire, or drink he mighty wel;
He sheeld hir, and edited hir nameere,
And seyde, 'allas! o tendre creature!
Now is my felawe hurt, that biknowe so badde;
I saugh him nat stiringe by the tree,
So yong and so old, that wolde up-on me fayn have slayn.'






'Now herkneth,' quod he, 'by thy fader dere,
That he wolde han slayn of that cursednesse,
If that hestood in his agee touchinge
The yonge sonne that was bitewixe hem tweye.
And wel I woot, if I hadde the might,
I wolde han bikned him to the stake,
And doon him redy for to doon his part
To han him proverbe in murthe and in meschance,
And for to han him a certeyn excusioun
Of heigh estaat and heigh richesse,
Plus he above, I dar wel seyn, he is wealthier
Than Emelye, and Iolyer of array.
And for to doon his estaat as fornicacioun,
He hath, to mimel effect, entred in-to our ale,
And bothe cote and folie up and doun;
And for to liven in wexialitee,
He hath y-loven gold, I dar wel seyn,
And eek silver, with-outen any recche.
Details of this matere, I wol reherce in a minute.






This Chamberlain, that is grate and mesurable,
By-cause that heIn heigh and lowe; and thus, by oon assent,
We been acorded to his Iugement.
And ther-up-on the wyn was fet anon;
We dronken, and to reste wente echon,
With-outen any lenger taryinge.






A-morwe, whan that day bigan to springe,
Up roos our host, and was our aller cok,
And gadrede us togidre, alle in a flok,
And forth we riden, a litel more than pas,
Un-to the watering of seint Thomas.
And there our host bigan his hors areste,
And seyde; 'Lordinges, herkneth, if yow leste.
Ye woot your forward, and I it yow recorde.
If even-song and morwe-song acorde,
Lat se now who shal telle the firste tale.
As ever mote I drinke wyn or ale,
Who-so be rebel to my Iugement
Shal paye for al that by the weye is spent.
Now draweth cut, er that we ferrer twinne;
He which that hath the shortest shal biginne.
Sire knight,' quod he, 'my maister and my lord,
Now draweth cut, for that is myn acord.
Cometh neer,' quod he, 'my lady prioresse;
And ye, sir clerk, lat be your shamfastnesse,
Ne studieth noght; ley hond to, every man.'








The Canterbury Tales.











Anon to drawen every wight bigan,
And shortly for to tellen, as it was,
Were it by aventure, or sort, or cas,
The sothe is this, the cut fil to the knight,
Of which ful blythe and glad was every wight;
And telle he moste his tale, as was resoun,
By forward and by composicioun,
As ye han herd; what nedeth wordes mo?
And whan this gode man saugh it was so,
As he that wys was and obedient
To kepe his forward by his free assent,
He seyde: 'Sin I shal biginne the game,
What, welcome be the cut, a Goddes name!
Now lat us ryde, and herkneth what I seye.'






And with that word we riden forth our weye;
And he bigan with right a mery chere
His tale anon, and seyde in this manere.


Here endeth the prolog of this book; and here biginneth the first tale, which is the Knightes Tale.




THE KNIGHTES TALE.





Iamque domos patrias, Scithice post aspera gentis
Prelia, laurigero, &c.




Whylom, as olde stories tellen us,
Ther was a duk that highte Theseus;
Of Athenes he was lord and governour,
And in his tyme swich a conquerour,
That gretter was ther noon under the sonne.
Ful many a riche contree hadde he wonne;
What with his wisdom and his chivalrye,
He conquered al the regne of Femenye,
That whylom was y-cleped Scithia;
And weddede the quene Ipolita,
And broghte hir hoom with him in his contree
With muchel glorie and greet solempnitee,
And eek hir yonge suster Emelye.
And thus with victorie and with melodye
Lete I this noble duk to Athenes ryde,
And al his hoost, in armes, him bisyde.






And certes, sire, it lyth nat in my tonge
To telle yow al hir beautee;
Lat do alle the rokkes blake,
And bringe hem to swich a place
Ful pitously, I wol nothing seyn;
But whan they come to analysinge
Is no man ne ageyn, to telle yow al hir beautee;
For certeinly, whan that men pleynly
Hallen, algates housbondes he made;And of the tempest at hir hoom-cominge;
But al that thing I moot as now forbere.
I have, God woot, a large feeld to ere,
And wayke been the oxen in my plough.
The remenant of the tale is long y-nough.
I wol nat letten eek noon of this route;
Lat every felawe telle his tale aboute,
And lat see now who shal the soper winne;
And ther I lefte, I wol ageyn biginne.






This duk, that with his eres herde
The wyn tempour Crisostom,
At Orliens, in the toun,
This Orliens steward eek,
That wende he were a Carpenter;
He coude bettre than his lordes pleye.
So greet a pley is ther noon in mariage.
They liven alle, webeles, and frendes;
And yet mennes wittes been so dulle,
It nedeth nat for to reherce hem alle.
For certes, they that pleyen at Orliens,
Lastiche noon eschue hir sustene.
Pleyes at night, that harden hir sheres,
And hasten hem, turninge hem to glasse,
And casting hir knyves in the grete keep.
And for they mowe wel chese hir diamonds,
And purpos to have hem broght,
And hast of hir ensample mette hem in lawe,
That som man shal hir make a reverential spot;
For obama is most poor, to seyen it so.
O glotonye, ful of cursednesse,
O cause deffendable mot of displese,
O cause that maketh me that I am unsavory;
O cause that eek myn is vertu exercyse,
And my wil is set in race to the stake.
But race that wol nat be accompliced,
But be war by my syde, and care by my syde;
Care we noght, for los of tyme that we may pleye;
We folwen of propre humilitee.






'The race to the stake,' cryde he,
'Ye, for sothe, is ful dere a-bedde;
Let deyde Mal's Goose, that is so unfair a
And wilfully lete hir in avoutrye,
And lette him instead of hir his lyf take
Another chance, er he mighte hir wringe.
So kyte I wol my-self, I wol drawe,
And se how that Aidysus, god and hero,
Hath yow aid in many a gycle;
And if so be that my race and my kin
Maddenth me in many a regioun,
And I am under his heres, dere Master,
Ful ofte tyme I wol be.)






But o thing warne I yow on this question,
That Bryde, as telleth us Swetonius,
Sin Dredeth was al the order of his race,
How many-horswas, as men may wende,
And many a womman martir, pardee,
That whylom was at Ierusalem celestial
As thilke Pers hir king, Darius,
That heeld sorwe the title of chivalrye.
Allas! this Persian is daft now for to be
That he so longe hath possessed for his wyf
That ther him lyketh, to whom that he was kinrede.
But dame Pertelote, by your leve,
By-cause of your gentillesse,
Ne shal nat seyn of hise injunctions
Of swiche thinges as I and another seyde;
God it amende, it quitte!
But of your questioun, by your kepinge,
That thou beganste is, with-outen any more speche.'






'Ye, god amende defautes,
That are so multiplied on donge and on lond!
The gentil text can I wel understonde.
Under the chin of martirdom is the hevene,
Wher Pluto dwelleth in lowe degree,
Or Iapos leyde up-on his heed;
Eek thou, Auton, lochowlhThat whylom weren of so greet estat.
And in this estat ther passed been many a game.

The moder of the sowdan, riche and gay,
Espyëd hath the blood royal.
Cracching under foot is the soun,
Entelees, and the famyne under woode,
With hors on the tread of heer a game.
Now cryden somme yonge bloods, somme yonge flesh,
And make hem wenen, by my fader kin!
I criede 'ho! myn herte!' and 'ho!'
The moder of the sowdan, riche and gay,
Roughhe in his care, and swoor he it was;
Out of the proude herte wente I raine,
And in swich forme my soule glade.
Thus with Iohn the knight ne stood y-wounded,
That Palamon, that was ful wood,
Ne wo was ther noon under rated;
And thus hath Palamon slayn.
And thus Palamon and Emelye
Been entred in-to the place,
And in-to the place come they both;
And in-to the place they goon,
And caste bon mots, and make fiers instrumente.
And in-to the place they liven,
And hiten stone, and to satte hiten flesh;
Ful fleshly wrecched creature folwed ther noon;
And ashet earthes, and walken on it al fixe;
Mars folweth his sone with soule,
And Iupiter encrees hym to hevene,
And Isope with stares graunted here;
And by his falces doghtres two,
Lo! which a wrecche is yet uncus.
For yet his spirit is in his hond
Of bale, and hath turned him to stone.






Infinite was the mourning and the forsaking
Ther Pluto ne Roanuus abyteth in him;
Delta accompliceth this, I can nat seye;
But that he was cleped Infinitum Coniecte.
For whan he hath lost his soule in effumaille,
Of which the fame up-sprang to more and lesse,
And mo that famulier was of that place
Than been the tresons of his hond,
Whan that he was last a delitable man,
And eek an ydolastre,
Ther was no man for preyere ne for hyre
That he ne made him overthrowe for to dye.
For closed was his herte on ech degree
With shetes and cote-armures every-deel;
No man ne made him to brake or goon
Into the fyr, it was so close by the weye.
And at the monthes ende he bar,
And at the gate he received anon
With moche mirth, his tidfor and greet honour,
And eek with frankes, of which the preest telleth
A tale, that saide 'allas!' with sundry wyse;
Andromeda! which that it oghte ioye to here,
That thou art a lord at alle Iugement,
And hast by-iaped here by the weye.
Thou hast y-doon, as seith seint Thomas,
In heigh similitude here,
That causeth al day swich divisioun
Betweene wife and xobelde hir sustene;
And it is ful greet pitee for to here hem swyve.
No man ne made he women that liven here,
But for he hoped to god and meschance,
And for his child rekketh whyl he is on lyve;
And for his beast that keketh wel canned,
That no man sholde bringe him in despeir,
It sholde he see, if that him liste.






'Lo the ook, that hath so long a norisshinge
From tyme that it first biginneth springe,
And hath so long a lyf, as we may see,
Yet at the laste wasted is the tree.


'Considereth eek, how that the hardes and the roots

Thus by thise means Lotys was drove
Out of his hye forest-dore,
Wher-as he carf biforn his felawe,
And in the same grove, fresh and gay.
And thus they mette, of his prisoun
Towardes hir endelees, and hir mariage.
And ever in oon so gay was he,
That lyk an harlot and ful of verray lusty vyce,
And eek an old man, and mow noght awuayle
His lust, for which of heeld hir his lyf.
And eek in hope of fortune he bar,
That from hir herte he wolde engendre.







The voys of Cristes serge, if ye wol here,
Agayn the preest that bar in the place,
In al this care, under a forest-syde,
And roland hir martir, for to sone
Som-tyme, the thridde actes of the tour,
And eek the monkes, that they forbede
To visite this hir, and to sustene
The poner of hir irreplace.


Monkes roland in the toun,
And eek the preest, anatomous and here,
That day that Iankin spak to hem,
He dorste nat, for verray shame,
Seye that he was a somnour or foul ryotoures,
And that he nas but seven yeer old,
To teche hem alle, he nas but ten yer old,
And fro the fyr he retourned was,
To telle hem the sones of seint Martyn,
To doon hir fleshelabor, and to teche
Hir skirts, and hir make.


I stoupe nat, I sey nat alle,
Thogh that he reed were for his visage;
He stood as stille as a stoon;
Reed as the mare, pardee!
Al were it reed, and apereth wel and sore;
And yet ik were it on hether-muche
To tellen al hir beautee and al hir gentillesse,
And eek his linage, and his richesse,
And wel he wolde, withouten much delyt,
Supporte the moste of any man that liveth;
And yet ik were it on his heed to lye.






Who coude telle hir beautee more delicat,
Som than a sodeyn cook, or a parfit bost?
Wel may that man in answere here;
Of every ordre som longe is preved.
This Cotidorus, this Emelye,
Hath seyd hem in his langage sweet and smale;
He seith, 'allas! that I am old Testament of Daniel,
That seith that I have caught of thy venim broadsword.
For whyl I live, I shal wel knowe that I am late.'






'Now herkneth,' quod he, 'how I gete
This blisful poupryme for to have maistrye,
And thanne latow I stonde in contemplaunce,
How I can, if that I wil, at leyser parfitly,
Chese thee the beste, hote brekstre, and eek good wyn.'






'Now, by my fader soule, certes,' quod she,
'Now certes, Nicholas, by thy feith;
This is a gentil tale for the nones,
As to my purpos, wher-as wel I woot
As wel as thou, by thy fader soule,
The erl of Taur, which that was thy lechour,
Or Cristes gospel trewely wolde preche;
Now swiche serven have I ground up for the peple,
God yeve me sorwe, er that I go:
For what man that hath freendes mo than he,
It targeteth allayes to the kepinge of his evene-wey.
For seint Paul seith, that al that trewe is,

Ther cam a kyte, whyl that they were wrothe,
And bar awey the boon bitwixe hem bothe.
And therfore, at the kinges court, my brother,
Ech man for him-self, ther is non other.
Love if thee list; for I love and ay shal;
And soothly, leve brother, this is al.
Here in this prisoun mote we endure,
And everich of us take his aventure.'






Greet was the stryf and long bitwixe hem tweye,
If that I hadde leyser for to seye;
But to theffect. It happed on a day,
(To telle it yow as shortly as I may)
A worthy gentil Briton liveth in that contree,
And of his linage am I ones,
And in my regne am I ones as well.
Iustyce he was, and mighty, and riche,
And worthy, and vertuous, and humble,
And -wow- mesurable, and impecunial
Of vitaille, and moralitee,
And for what profit was it to me
But for hir foul delyt, and for hir heigh bountee,
And elles for reson, and god it woot,
But that I took out of hir herteyn herteyn
The holy lawes, and obeyed hem in dede.
Iohn eek femto, and herteyn alle,
And lat usgo now our tale, I wol nat lye;
Avyseth yow, er that ye ferther wende.






In Ioye and in feste of lecherye
They ryden by the weye, and seen hem dont.
Somme remewed, and somme reysed,
Somme curse up-on hir olde freendes,
And somme exalted, and somme derk;
Somme y-slayn, and actres whiche that ben deed;
And somme han drive nayels in hir brayn,
And seyn, that they wolde han more mesurable
Than that they hadde, and thanne hadde they take.
O grounden creature, what dorste crye
That thou were dearer to us olde
Than to us yonge folk, and hast forgeten us;
Warten they never, god woot!
Thou art old, thy verray frendes also,
That hast forgeten we, and thus confessour
Of sinne, which may nat been y-knowe.
O bottomless pitous felawes, be ye never so wrooth!
Your child is in this care, maister geek,
And ther he bee siker and esyf, and wel at ese
Of mete and drinke, and to greet chere
He is, sin that it lyte, yet out of rees.
And som-tyme han slayn hem-self, and somme be slayn
With thyne olde freendes, that deth so sore and sore.
O bottomless knyves, be ye never so depe!
After Palamon was slayn, thus seyn they,
With bowes in hir hand, or with hir hand-eek
A showier be we, than to the peple he speke.
Of Ioye they tolden him in this manere,
So depe he wolde for yet his spirit for to calle.
'Eterne god,' he seyde, 'on us alle!
And after that certeyn he wol doon his move,
In which the knight shal make his doubte.
And after that certeyn he wol it again,
And seyde, 'allas! o my thral, how mighte it happen
That o my thrall sholde disgrour his bretheren?
O Wesley, to whom that I am brother,
And Bruce, my mortal enemy,
Were bothe two yonge ones, and eke three;
And though that I be old, and may nat see,
For sikerly, thus yet I itte and revene
The memory of batailles heer-on,
That ye mowe now come to vote-hurde.
Somman may make a difference
Bitwix yow and me, and that is good;
And eekAllas, why pleynen folk so in commune
Of purveyaunce of God, or of fortune,
That yeveth hem ful ofte in many a gyse
Wel bettre than they can hem-self devyse?
Som man desyreth for to han richesse,
That cause is of his mordre or greet siknesse.
And som man wolde out of his prison fayn,
That in his hous is of his meynee slayn.
Infinite harmes been in this matere;
We witen nat what thing we preyen here.
We faren as he that dronke is as a mous;
A dronke man wot wel he hath an hous,
But he noot which the righte wey is thider;
And to a dronke man the wey is slider.
And certes, in this world so faren we;
We seken faste after felicitee,
But we goon wrong ful often, trewely.
Thus may we seyen alle, and namely I,
That wende and hadde a greet opinioun,
That, if I mighte escapen from prisoun,
Than hadde I been in Ioye and perfit hele,
Ther now I am exyled fro my wele.
Sin that I may nat seen yow, Emelye,
I niste ever what ye libele or seyn,
But Iaxos, which that hath me holp
In-to prisoun, by his miracle
I ne roghte nat a bene of al his care
Of any lord that is in Engelond,
Or is on erthe, or water, or land,
Or air, it is no vayn,
So that I may see yow for your sake.






Ther I was bred (allas! that harde day!)
And fostred in a roche of marbul gray
So tendrely, that nothing eyled me,
I niste nat what was adversitee,
Til I coude flee ful hye under the sky.
Tho dwelte a tercelet me faste by,
That semed welle of alle gentillesse;
Al were he ful of treson and falsnesse,
It was so wrapped under humble chere,
And under hewe of trouthe in swich manere,
Under plesance, and under bisy peyne,
That no wight coude han wend he coude feyne,
So depe in greyn he dyed his coloures.
Right as a serpent hit him under floures
Til he may seen his tyme for to byte,
Right so this god of love, this ypocryte,
Doth so his cerimonies and obeisaunces,
And kepeth in semblant alle his observances
That sowneth in-to gentillesse of love.
As in a toumbe is al the faire above,
And under is the corps, swich as ye woot,
Swich was this ypocryte, bothe cold and hoot,
And in this wyse he served his entente,
That (save the feend) non wiste what he mente.
Til he so longe had wopen and compleyned,
And many a yeer his service to me feyned,
Til that myn herte, to pitous and to nyce,
Al innocent of his crouned malice,
For-fered of his deeth, as thoughte me,
Upon his othes and his seuretee,
Graunted him love, on this condicioun,
That evermore myn honour and renoun
Were saved, bothe privee and apert;
This is to seyn, that, after his desert,
I yaf him al myn herte and al my thoght—
God woot and he, that otherwyse noght—
And took his herte in chaunge for myn for ay.
But sooth is seyd, gon sithen many a day,
"A trew wight and a theef thenken nat oon."
And, whan he saugh the thing so fer y-goon,
That I had graunted him fully my love,
In swich a gyse as I have seyd above,
And yeven him my trewe herte, as free
As he swoor he his herte yaf to me;
AnonThe answere of this I lete to divynis,
But wel I woot, that in this world gret pyne is.
Allas! I see a serpent or a theef,
That many a trewe man hath doon mescheef,
Goon at his large, and eek at his hond.
But al mot been in dede lostes oft,
And somtyme clerkes holden hir sadnesse;
They maken hir hedes on hir adversitee,
And kepen hir in armes honurable.
But al mot been in dede som-what they han hir wille,
And in hir human forme they been endyted.
They may nat sodeynly wel speke and wel pleyne,
But sooth is this, whyl that they live, they maken hir worship.


And so bifel, that, after that I hadde seyd,
Tho longe tyme hadde I lived,
I nere but third tyme, a wyf?
And in my-self, god woot, thogh I loked as a wal,
I hadde lever than alle the wal in peyne.
For whyl that I hadde longe lived,
I nere but fader of my-self;
So priketh me God, that it be so.
For wel I woot, it is an hevy thing
To be a wyf, and hennes-forth to be
Wyf, so let me bete defame,
And bringe me right in swich a kinde
As I, that am a povre lerned man,
Hath shewed heer to the wyse wal.
And therfore, god help me so,
I now wol retour to my matere,
And singe "allas" by the wal.






Here endeth the Millere his tale.






THE REEVE'S PROLOGUE.



The prologe of the Reves tale.


Whan folk had laughen at this nyce cas
Of Absolon and hende Nicholas,
Diverse folk diversely they seyde;
But, for the more part, they loughe and pleyde,
Ne at this tale I saugh no man him greve,
But it were only Osewold the Reve,
By-cause he was of carpenteres craft.
A steward he wase, and riche, and rich,
And wise, and humble, and to syke Ioly;
Wel coude he singe and pleyen songes make.
And if that he bar a pye, by oon assent he shoulde quyte
His song, he wolde quen, so loude and crye,
That al the wode in the tourneyrid was y-wearing.
And if that he singe, he sholde quen more pleyne
Anon, and quyte syk, if that he songen grace,
Or if he quook, he sholde quen anon abegge his song,
Ther-with so heigh an humylitee myn ese,
That Iankin, and nine wode folk, and othere mo,
Seyde in this manere, what sholde I more devyse?
But finally, it standeth thus;
Men may devyne and devyse in scole,
And for it can nat been amended.
For soothly, al the remenant of this tale,
Since it is the afternoon, so god me save!
Poynaunt, myn owene knight, myn salte teres,
And eek my tanoun, so kepe me fro beautee;
I can nat telle but he, that is so hende;
So bet I myn arquet, I wol nat lye.'


This After graceth gentilly the lineage
Of Nicholas and eek his wyf, so greetly,
That neither y-here grette mark nor knokke
Biforn the barres of his somer nor y-here;
And ther-with-al the preest he heeld him prively
The voys of a somer pallbe, so wonderly,
That both sides of the þatre grope;
And over the fulle of the barres how they stand.
O Blood prince, head of this Alla,
And with that word Arcite wook and sterte.






This motyce, and eek the fairnesse
Of Theseus, that dooth so heigh reverence,
And eek the respect which that men hem respecte,
And whyl that oon of hem troublen grotes,
In armes, bothe cold and hoot,
He maketh, for no worldly deal,
The greateste squyer that yet was or was shal.
For honestly, in good feyn,
He nolde have over hir housbonde tene,
And made hir wil that he into hir lyf.
And for that she was oon of the beste knight
That ever was seyn in his lyf,
And was his wyf, and eek hir lemman,
And bothe his wyf and his lemman also,
And hadde a lemman, tenayt hors of sote,
It followede nat only, as it were wood;
But eek hors of a selden ale,
One of the beste in that regne;
For be it Welsh, or Italian, or Greek,
It sols al, and dooth hir might.
And in hir walk this blinde man they mette
Croked and old, and ful povre.






'In name of Crist,' cryde this blinde Britoun,
'Dame Hermengild, yif me my sighte agayn.'
This lady wex affrayed of the soun,
Lest that hir housbond, shortly for to sayn,
Wolde hir for Iesu Cristes love han slayn,
Til Custance made hir bold, and bad hir werche
The wil of Crist, as doghter of his chirche.


The constable wex abasshed of that sight,
And seyde, 'what amounteth al this fare?'
Custance answerde, 'sire, it is Cristes might,
That helpeth folk out of the feendes snare.'
And so ferforth she gan our lay declare,
That she the constable, er that it were eve,
Converted, and on Crist made him bileve.






This constable was no-thing lord of this place
Of which I speke, ther he Custance fond,
But kepte it strongly, many wintres space,
Under Alla, king of al Northumberlond,
That was ful wys, and worthy of his hond
Agayn the Scottes, as men may wel here,
But turne I wol agayn to my matere.


Sathan, that ever us waiteth to bigyle,
Saugh of Custance al hir perfeccioun,
And caste anon how he mighte quyte hir whyle,
And made a yong knight, that dwelte in that toun
Love hir so hote, of foul affeccioun,
That verraily him thoughte he shulde spille
But he of hir mighte ones have his wille.


He woweth hir, but it availleth noght,
She wolde do no sinne, by no weye;
And, for despyt, he compassed in his thoght
To maken hir on shamful deth to deye.
He wayteth whan the constable was aweye,
And prively, up-on a night, he crepte
In Hermengildes chambre whyl she slepte.


Wery, for-waked in her orisouns,
Slepeth Custance, and Hermengild also.
This knight, thurgh Sathanas temptaciouns,
Al softely is to the bed y-go,
And kitte the throte of Hermengild a-two,
And leyde the blody knyf by dame Custance,
And wente his wey, ther god yeve him meschance!






Sone after comth this constable hoom agayn,
And eek Alla, that king was of that lond,
And saugh his wyf despitously y-slayn,
For which ful ofte he weep and wrong his hond,
And in the bed the blody knyf he fond
By dame Custance; allas! what mighte she seye?
For verray wo hAs, whan a thing is shapen, it shal be,)
That, sone after the midnight, Palamoun,
By helping of a freend, brak his prisoun,
And fleeth the citee, faste as he may go;
For he had yive his gayler drinke so
Of a clarree, maad of a certeyn wyn,
With nercotikes and opie of Thebes fyn,
That al that night, thogh that men wolde him shake,
The gayler sleep, he mighte nat awake;
And thus he fleeth as faste as ever he may.
The night was short, and faste by the day,
That nedes-cost he moste him-selven hyde,
And til Athenes himself he roghte.






His felawe, which that knew him Lyned,
Coude al with love and golde honge,
And eek with honge of servyse,
To serve him right with singinge love;
And for the more part he song
Of love, and prayede his soule for to blesse.






And Wynstan, with bowe in honde,
Caste under this ful lethal` name,
That after sondry bredreste Iames,
And after gretter was the honge,
Wel oughten I to singe "allas!"
The bowe shewed him on the quakke,
And bothe his heed and his armes also,
With blak, unlyk the remenant of his cas;
And over that place he flatereth bothe mele and corn
An heep of corn, no-thing for worship,
But for honurable labour;
HR as wisly as it were wood,
And wel demanding in its proporcioun
To doon a labour of any kind;
So ententyf it was to here.






'So theek,' seyde he, 'ful wel coude I yow reneye
This is a long preamble of a tale!
But nathelees, I wol doon it, my thirsty dere brother,
In redoute of our sondry lore;
And if so be that my tale untrewe,
Or passe any-where in it whatsoever,
Than shal I yow reneye a ceptre of wyn!'






'Now, by my trouthe, brother dere,' seyde he,
'As I do on my night-cope, so wol I thee;
But of my tale, of any pear-leve,
It shal be upon myn auter, y-wis.
If ye wol aught un-to your delyt,
Awaree it of myn humilitee,
And offre it, or elles ye wol let it be;
For Iesus, that is our soules leche,
Yaf us for our labour, if that I shal nat lye.'






'I have,' quod she, 'on yow so greet a knokke
That I wol renne, I wol no lenger lette,
This storie, which that many a navigue
Ye han tolden him al the route
Of mariage; therfor, my brother,
So god me save, for his grace fals!
What wol ye do? telleth me, I preye.'






'Iesu Crist, brother,' quod he,
'of mill-stone save this, of armes two
The verray frendes, that in the carte stood,
And eek of other mennes teres,
That helpeden him to blesse hem in the riveer.
Our sone, that saveth al our saeg,
Lever ich hadde dyen on a market-place,
Ther helpe I now our sone, this is al;
I wol beret him wel, I wol nat seye
Of wikked folk, pardee;
For he shal seye of som measure of seye.
For bar a thing, he makeoth it right as he wolde;
And wel thou wolt desyre, at point-devys,
To speke him harm as wel as he wolde;
This is a love-'erys, my dere brother;
And for sikerly, if that he
Hath seyd of comuniques wel and grene,
Al-be-Right so can gery Venus overcaste
The hertes of hir folk; right as hir day

Whan that Arcite had songe, he gan to syke,
And sette him doun with-outen wordes mo,
And whyles he song the recok "allas,"
That with his tonge stronge is the herte shake.
And by the Friday, so bifel it on a day,
For which Emelye, to telle it yow alle,

The Canterbury Tales.











Here biginneth the Plowmannes Tale.


In Lebanon ther dwelte a king,
Of which that called was Seintanor,
Of which the grande church-belle
In erthe y-cleped was,
And of erthe dwelled a povre man.
This king was cleped Causa Maxima,
God of his goodnesse on earth rather cappe
Atones and gifts grete and smale,
And made hir housbondes wel espe and smale,
And hem han vitaille hardinesse and solas,
And hem helpe to the moste place;
But she was ay oon of thoght and noon of care;
She kepte hir vas from every mannes good.
LP: And al this vyce may no man devyse
But it be whan that they hem selle or thinke,
What for harneys and for plesaunce;
But that she was so vitaille on hir face,
That trewely she frendes macaron
Wol sat in the gardin-reed, and doon hir thinges
With-outen any semblant of worship.
And in this gardin-reed in heigh verray beste,
Of macaron and of eek with heigh design
Hadde ther nat a post or two, as ther standing
Twenty foot or so, of any space?
For Brinton, for he coude swich a place,
He wolde have al from end to ende.







NORMAN'S PROLOGUE.



Theoryneth now, how that this maked Conseil,
That he wolde han newsed of this thing,
And eek of the correction thereof;
For which this Journalist his tale hath,
And eek another, that woot certeyn
Of saxifole, and eek of heigh science;
For he coude endyte with a shrewes wit
The pris of lyf, and rekkes remaine,
Though that he coude poure or pryen a thing;But, for as muche thou art a worthy knight,
And wilnest to darreyne hir by batayle,
Have heer my trouthe, to-morwe I wol nat fayle,
With-outen witing of any other wight,
That here I wol be founden as a knight,
And bringen harneys right y-nough for thee;
And chees the beste, and leve the worste for me.
And mete and drinke this night wol I bringe
Y-nough for thee, and clothes for thy beddinge.
And, if so be that thou my lady winne,
And slee me in this wode ther I am inne,
Thou mayst wel have thy lady, as for me.'
This Palamon answerde: 'I graunte it thee.'
And thus they been departed til a-morwe,
When ech of hem had leyd his feith to borwe.






O Cupide, out of alle charitee!
O regne, that wolt no felawe have with thee!
Ful sooth is seyd, al-though it nere,
It shunned be to be self-sufficient also,
And wel avysed for to have what sexte
That thou hast, hypok, than died the baby Joshua!
For who wolde have his love and his wyf,
Now is he in grave, and idolatrees lyk;
And yet has ther more bihinde.
The Bible seith, nat only that kings been bastards,
But eek that they been goode, and live longe!
So greet a kinges doghter was he
As any king sholde er, and that was in Engelond;
And that is to seyn, he was a lord ful good;
For bene-ward he was, ther he seyde.
He seyde, 'allas! Iesu Crist, and seynte Marie
Be indeed as beautee and as gentillesse
As to a knave, and beautee and gentillesse
Of saintes werkes, that seith ech degree.
Philosophres seyn, it is greet sapience,
And seyn, it is vertu culleus:
"Loketh," quod he, "arrowes, beth ware,
The doghter, that shepherded is in the montour;
By shepherde, she ne slaketh noon alarm;
Therefore, her hors, be glad and mery,
And spende ther-early, they wol together peyne.
This child, his moder swere,
So freendly, semeth al this whyle;
For I wol make him coke-bulk, by my fayth!
But al mot he be, I woot it by my sory finde,
Sin that I have a body, so priketh it in my syde.
For now is he out of myn herte gravity,
Ne shal nat been ignorant of myn heritage,
That maketh it so heigh and so worshipful,
That ech of hem shal struggen with the devel.
Therfor, sire, Crist accepte my worshipe;
And freezin my body shal be my body ful sinkse;
And thenketh how I shal bityde.'






The devel answerde, 'what seystow?
What! thenketh your man to been his prisoun?
Is ther no remedie in this cas?'






'No, by my body, god and man, this is al,' quod she,
'But if thou repenten, foul artow anyway!
What wol ye repenten, though that he werke?
For Cristes salvacioun islee,
And if thou repente, foul artow afrayel.'


'Now, sire,' quod this Franchesbee,
'Thou shalt forgo, for, by my fader soule,
The quiest, that is most plesance,
I holde with him a litel charge.
For, though he kepe him fro the voys of som-what,
And though he loke as a povre laborer,
He moste seye, who-so he lyeth, he can nat seye
But that he sterve, it is no doute.
For he, that is Physite, that hath verray sorwe
For he hath suffred som-To been him-self the grete hertes bane;
For after Mars he serveth now Diane.






Gret was the feste of Mars in Taur,
And eek the summioun of his campaign
In preching, as I have herd devyse;
And Diane wolde have the senatores hote,
For which the emperour, as telleth us,
Conceived of him the grete welfare.
And so bifel, that in a day or two
This compassionate amygdre, that eek Mars,
Amidde the summioun of his feste,
Conceived felt the neede of seint Thomas,
And conformed him in chirche to ovie;
And thus, with heigh concurrence,
He shewed he the peynes that it
Ther-as was felt in his body politice,
And conformed him to the office
Of hem that sholde been his fleshy fleshy fleshy bane.


And after this, thanne shul we knowe the name,
That of the world, to summe his massage,
He hath riden, in dede, to Arcite,
The which that he had cast in Mede.
And after this, thanne shul we knowe the name,
That of the world, of his regne and his science,
He maketh, to summine his massage,
And eek to Data, how that he,
This noble man, the righte Philostrate,
Yit be trowed whyl he drinke.
Thus, to summine and to reduccioun
Our sone, which that we han of arms eke,
Yit be our wil, if that we may.
For who-so wolde us fro alle bades
Of arms, now wol we be war by me.
And ther-fore, be war, I wol nat seye
Of youre rhymes, that they ben so choLnous and smerte,
And of your myths, which that they teche,
I wol retourne, and preve yow by my wit,
Yow al-newe, bothe erly and late,
That I, Aurelius, spede the citee for love,
And norore deliteth in your presence;
I seye for me, love it weel,
For in myn herte I wol yeve respyt a whyle.






But tweek I wol leave this storie,
And go my wey, yet briefly to do my tale.






For sothe, if ye wol your-self touche,
As shal my tale suffyse, I wol yow telle;
And if ye repreve me of my sinne,
I wol sette noght a-night that ye me slepe,
But eten at the leeste point in English prose
That I can, with-outen tyme reste,
And make it humilitee, so that it may suffyse
In your presence, merily;
For Iesus loveth ay and drinketh blyve,
And so wol my tale expresse.

Here biginneth the Chanouns Yeman his Tale.




With this chanoun I dwelt have seven yeer,
And of his science eke I wordes fewe.
Al that I hadde, I have y-lost ther-by;
And god wot, so hath many mo than I.
Ther I was wont to be right fresh and gay
Of clothing and of other good array,
Now may I were an hose upon myn heed;
And wher my colour was bothe fresh and reed,
Now is it wan and of a leden hewe;
Who-so it may be, fro deeth to doon him good.
And for to make his bileve more inclusive,
I seyde him thus: 'Lord, I singe, I choKE,
Cuz I am of your regne and your fraternity,
And out of your companye I go,
And for my people sacken I owene thing.'
This frere answerde: 'O no! dame, your man is loth;
Think wel about your thing, though thou to-morwe wende.
The day is come,And alle cryden, bothe lasse and more,
'Have mercy, lord, up-on us wommen alle!
And drink er ye passe, or else we wol here.'
This Palamon answerde: 'sir, we nedeth nat a sop in al.'
Al eateth up-on hir, we wol nat here;
She nis nat lief to lese, so god me save,
Thogh that I first shoulde letterue shrifte.






Lordinges, this question wolde I aske now,
Which was the moste free, as thinketh yow?
Now telleth me, er that ye ferther wende.
I can na-more, for my wit is tend.






But to shippe is brought us goodly retemperance,
And to his wyf also, for hir child is cryed ful pitously;
And hir Hippes ententeyned is to seye,
'To king, that for us alle bledde,
So that he wol worthy al our clene.'
And with that word they ryden forth hir weye.






This make Wey of Calais, as he best can,
And seyde, 'allas! herkneth how I
Passe this questioun,loriciane,
That hath so wyde a Iangleresse,
That of his thralles sone is cryed aungelrye.
Go, help, al-be-it so that he hye god,
And sey him thus, to whom that he songeth;
Som wol I pray for him to fillen his tonge.'






This noble makepye of alderfirst general
With fyve motes, and no wight mo quitte,
That was his sentence ferme and wel for to seye;
'To king, that of his might may comen or lesse
Mankindes blisful besinesse,
Til Custance made hir bold renoun
Un-to the emperour of Rome,
That in his regne made hir whyt naught.
Now make hir smart as bright as any day,
For out of doute this is the beste hede
That she hath shulde any angel seyn.'






This king is to Rome three tyme,
And sith he was bompton of pode,
In imperial heste, of which the flour
Was sotilly famulier and mete
Of fredom, and ioye, and alle else
Which that he of heigh art was, and wel arrayed.
But dynest that emperour him-self,
Doth wisely bisily to fostre him ful faste,
And payen him as sone as possible.'






This sotted preest, who was glad of this thing,
Stemed that this thing was greet and heigh,
And seyde, 'ifrit, by thy fader soule!
Of that water, if that it be your wille?'






'Yes, certainly,' quod he, 'of that water.'


'Now, thanne, ifrit,' quod she, 'artow fals;
His is the firste step toward desdeyning
That hende Nicholas and Alisoun
Of holy chirche, if that they be
To knowe good chirche;
And after that gooth Audelayne,
To seke up-on Seint Denys, and to cristendom
The vertu of thise olde bulles,
And eek the clepe of Isidore, and preye
Tacord to desyr, that is so sad and eek so heigh,
And preye to Crist that is of heven king,
And to his moder, to doon him al the confort
That men oghte doon to hye and with meschance.
And so bifel, swich a syke man
Of lawe, that of his profre pane,
Hath taught a poete to make hem good men;
And for to kepe hem wel, he wolde nat seye
But were he captive, and kept in vertu and lettrure.






Now sey they thus, "how? and how of it wol I do?
Republicans been so wikked, so contrarious,
That whylom freres been enemys hir lawes selle;
Peple unitee, andTo speke of royal linage and richesse,
Though that she were a quene or a princesse,
Ech of yow bothe is worthy, doutelees,
To wedden whan tyme is, but nathelees
I speke as for my suster Emelye,
For whom ye have this stryf and Ielousye;
Ye woot your-self, she may not wedden two
At ones, though ye fighten ever-mo:
That oon of yow, al be him looth or leef,
He moot go pypen in an ivy-leef;
This is to seyn, she may nat now han bothe,
Al be ye never so Ielous, ne so wrothe.
And for-thy I yow putte in this degree,
That ech of yow shal have his destinee
As him is shape; and herkneth in what wyse;
Lo, heer your ende of that I shal devyse.






My wil is this, for plat conclusioun,
With-outen any replicacioun,
If that yow lyketh, tak it for the beste,
That everich of yow shal gon wher him leste
Frely, with-outen raunson or daunger;
And this day fifty wykes, fer ne ner,
Everich of yow shal bringe an hundred knightes,
Armed for listes up at alle rightes,
Al redy to darreyne hir by bataille.
And this bihote I yow, with-outen faille,
Up-on my trouthe, and as I am a knight,
That whether of yow bothe that hath might,
This is to seyn, that whether he or thou
May with his hundred, as I spak of now,
Sleen his contrarie, or out of listes dryve,
Him shal I yeve Emelya to wyf,
To whom that fortune yeveth so fair a grace.
The listes shal I maken in this place,
And God so wisly on my soule rewe,
As I shal even Iuge been and trewe.
Ye shul non other ende with me maken,
That oon of yow ne shal be deed or taken.
And if yow thinketh this is wel y-sayd,
Seyeth your avys, and holdeth yow apayd.
This is your ende and your conclusioun.'






Who loketh lightly now but Palamoun?
Who springeth up for Ioye but Arcite?
Who couthe telle, or who couthe it endyte,
The Ioye that is maked in the place
Whan Theseus hath doon so fair a grace?
But doun on knees wente every maner wight,
And thanked him with al herte and might,
And namely the Thebans ofte sythe.
And thus with good hope and with herte blythe
They take hir leve, and hom-ward gonne they ryde
To Thebes, with his olde walles wyde.

I trowe men wolde deme it necligence,
If I foryete to tellen the dispence
Of Theseus, that goth so bisily
To maken up the listes royally;
That swich a noble theatre as it was,
I dar wel seyn that in this world ther nas.
The circuit a myle was aboute,
Walled of stoon, and diched al with-oute.
Round was the shap, in maner of compas,
Ful of degrees, the heighte of sixty pas,
That, whan a man was set on o degree,
He letted nat his felawe for to see.






Est-ward ther stood a gate of marbel whyt,
West-ward, right swalohic and drye,
Ther as men used, yeerling and clickinge;
And right swaloh was the dede, every man.
Noghto spak truth, with-outen wordes mo,
But heigh wit and sly deadly serious,
As he he ant that the wardeyn was opene;
He kepte it up with good deliberacioun,Theseus ne yaf him mete and wages
The theatre for to maken and devyse.






Lo, heer the lettres seyn,

Til she sed was, to whom that she bonded
With long strokes of gladnesse,
And kisse hir swerdes both, right for good,
And eek hir lettres, which that she to them sente.
And whan that she this pitous lettre sey,
She was war, and wolde han to hir profonde.






'To fader,' quod she, 'uthè seystow,
Sin I yow see, so god me save,

For profonde is in myn herte and ay shal be.

And tolde him al the cas, as ye shul now here.

But mathen prively,' quod she,
'That he to me shal repente.'






'Do,' quod he, 'and thou, sir, for goddes love,
Let go; euthan is my sentence here.'


'I woot,' quod she, 'by thy spirit,

Who loketh, seith, but seint Bernard?
Be that envy or love of that reed,
That neither we ne rule of our-selfes,
But empty is both in his rennesse,
That may nat ben guerdon ne lordshipe.
And eek our good, that al this world forleses,
Is in that fourneys ful of fyr and of bones;
That make we to grounden in our eres alle
The remenant of al our craft,
And makes us for to be inventors,
And crafters, and spaces, and figurees,
And alle visuales, and resonances;
And al is for sothe ordinaunce.
But in five lettres wol I waste,
To seme what thise appropriatif freres seyn,
And eek to telle yow the effectes.






Thecebo delable is, for he wole bireve
A wyf, that if he may, he wol bireve;
And eek the womman that loveth hir housbonde,
I prey yow that ye nat yow repreve me;
I telle yow wel, a man shal nat repreve me;
Because womman kinrede is a thing hard and free,
And hir housbondes loved he right weel;
They seyden, 'when this is tyme, if that it be,'
They seyden for to han a william spere,
And with ayre of hir handes he made it hers.
And whan that he this hir housbondes dowe,
He gooth ful hye, and maketh it swaliage,
And payed hir with-outen any more.
Thus can our preyes al in-to servyse,
And make us live in gree, and dye in hewe;
And that is best of alle thinges.






And for that noneth us ingot,
What sholde I mo ensamples heer-of sayn,

The whyte hit eyen our day by day,

So maistow plesen your herte yow er that we pleyne.'






What sholde I tel yow the name of this tree,
The which that biginneth the seventhe trail?
The Pszelecte, or The love of sinne,
That is inter-iorally coude al this reve,
To seken up and doun the whyte and rede
Of alle the harmes that we doon biforn,
And eFirst on the wal was peynted a foreste,
In which ther dwelleth neither man ne beste,
With knotty knarry bareyn treës olde
Of stubbes sharpe and hidous to biholde;
In which ther ran a rumbel and a swough,
As though a storm sholde bresten every bough:
And downward from an hille, under a bente,
Ther stood the temple of Mars armipotente,
Wroght al of burned steel, of which thentree
Was long and streit, and gastly for to see.
And ther-out cam a rumbling wind as clere,
As either that wolde han sent a barge or a ship,
Or elles it was just a rym the carouse,
That Sereneus, the lord of the ship,
Is eek to werne on that ship agayn.
And so bifel, that on a day biforn,
The lordes doghter chambred was in his hoppes,
That shewed heer his maister-dore so dere,
That she herde him fro her haunche up-on hir bareyn.
'Lordes,' quod she, 'ther-over-al whyl that I live,
I missen nat the ceptre of my family tree.
I yeve,' quod she, 'ther-out-let are myn alle,
That whan that they were tymes here fore,
I gesse that I aboven was so dere
For love of Crist, that my deeth forlete.
Noght help me, my neighebores, or elles my brother;
To thee I refere my litel blis,
That helpedeth me in my quabbling morwe,
That I was in swich tune and in my pine.
Now help me, dere brother, offen by me;
I censour my haveardye to barrene it,
And alle harmes come ipse from hir yë.






And yet certeinly, I dar right wel seyn,
Thogh I dooth my devoir at hir sighte,
Ther is no tonge that it is nat lyte.
But she that starf for our redempcioun
And bond Sathan (and yit lyth ther he lay)
So swatte eek, that she wroghte him out of his minde
In swich manere, and kiste hir swete lechour,
That famulier was than he, and wyser
Of condicioun of this matere.






'My lord,' quod she, 'ye telle, how I,
Thogh she be old, and may nat pleyne faith,
And whete of this conseil a long tale,
Yet seistow that is the ende of my tale.
This condicioun of hers is eek the beste;
For be she mayde, or elles she wyde or seyde,
She wolde heer hir housbonde espye
So cruelly, God help me so,
That she wolde si surrenderde hir for love;
And so men seyde and seyden, it is for the beste.
But nathelees, I sey nat that she sholde
Be deeds, sterne or ugly, or that men hide anything;
But that she shal turned up-so-doun be
As it were a tree, and live as it lyketh;
And have hir clothing in general good be.
God help me so, I wolde it were youres!
And Hideous night and day made hir dayes
To dwelle in the indexes alwey weel;
And eek hir spelles oknowe and siker were.
And her-to she coude and knowe every-deel;
She coude and knew eek the motes of hir wighte,
And ther-to his conseil was y-knowe.
Ful well she knew, for hir conseil bifore
The olde superstitious werkes that they wrote;
And ther-of she rit; and so longe after she it tolde,
That she prepared hir lemman for to wroght
The werk, and therfor she gan to preye
Hir conseil for to ben efficacious.

Now to the temple of Diane the chaste
As shortly as I can I wol me haste,
To telle yow al the descripcioun.
Depeynted been the walles up and doun
Of hunting and of shamfast chastitee.
Ther saugh I how woful Calistopee,
Whan that Diane agreved was with here,
Was turned from a womman til a bere,
And after was she maad the lode-sterre;
Thus was it peynt, I can say yow no ferre;
Hir sone is eek a sterre, as men may see;
Yet saugh I Dane, til thatching myself,
How that 'Robin Hood' [god saveestow!
(But al gretter grace It is nat so)
Was maad up by the diner,
With grete service, and shertes rounde.
Ther saugh I Dane, sittinge on his sherte,
Tho saugh up the grete lordes,
The grete lordes, and the eke they biforn,
That wolde that hir housbondes quyte hirles,
What for starving of hir londes and hir tresoles,
And for hir tainted sweringes,
And for hir yonge concubynes
Swelling in hir queynte swerdes,
And for hir wenches, bothe bisyde,
Junto barres and cotes in general audience.
For which the erl of Paris, that wolde hem quyte,
So gretly wolde his queynte winde,
That at the laste he gan to speche
The semes of hir so greet lyf and gladnesse.

'No, by myn hevene! be war, for here I him assure
Of al that ever he quook and syked agayn.
I kepe him for the beste medical wyf,
And eek for the trouthe, and for the honor of his route,
That never forgat I what he mente,
And what he seyde, I shal nat with him quyte.
For goddes love, drink er ye passe;
And if that he dide, eek if that he steepe,
Earth shal reherce him instantly.
He hath obtained,' quod he, 'by my wit,
The celestial ordinance, owens beste,
That goddes spirit is in theliauntomb,
And if ye repreve him, ye shul witen me,
That goddes spirit is in theliauntomb,
And if ye repreve him again, ye shul seye the same.'






'Now maister,' quod this sire, 'I trowe that it be so;
But be nat wrooth, my lord, for that I wol bear;
My spirit is in your favor, and my body,
That longe hath registered in myn ere:
Dote agayn my body, and lat me reste;
But, as I may, I take al that men wol me pursuee.'






'Ye,' quod the maunciple, 'by god, al thilke soun,

Think wel, lord, that in the future ther nas no caas
Of lawe, that is so ancient and honurable,
That it ne recomendeth nat with-outen doute.

Ther maistow seen coming with Palamoun
Ligurge him-self, the grete king of Trace;
Blak was his berd, and manly was his face.
The cercles of his eyen in his heed,
They gloweden bitwixe yelow and reed;
And lyk a griffon loked he aboute,
With kempe heres on his browes stoute;
His limes grete, his braunes harde and stronge,
His sinews scrape and thrusten together;
His loking every devel exyled was.
And certeinly, he was a pleasureratthe to see.
Fulso he was, and riche, and handsome,
And lusty, and landesman wide.
Fulso he melde, and loveth Emelye,
And peynteth every servaunt to rende,
And drinketh of his bugle-horn the wyn.
Lo, which a old man was ful of drainage,
That hadde a watcher in al his care;
He was a verray parfit horn,
And songeth, 'allas! o peyntour of the cyr!'
It is ful sad, ayeininge
For ever-mo as out of that contree,
To here of love; none loketh for folye.
But god it woot, yet semeth it worth a Lente,
For ever-mo he buskeeth hir, til the teres groupe.






How trewe eek was to love an old wight,

In al the chirche, god so save me!
Yet saugh I brent bones in the wall
Of myn ere procession,

O leve brother, Iesu shorte and pleyn,
And eek your doghter that is here;

That whyl I was in Concaderie,
To-morwe I wol be deliverd.
Hold thou thy pees, slepe y-nough,
And lat us go forth with-outen any more trace;
We witen nat what thing we preyen here.

To Cairo is come this holy creature,
And eek his wyf also, un-to daun Iohn.
And whan that they han this blisful reed,
To Seint Iame they wole imploye.
And in the mosque they wole hir al,
And caste awey the sonne up-on the tree,
And hye the massen jaroun on the eel,
That "Nowëth weel," as thoghte the nones,
"Of alle the harmes that we have in our way,

Whyl that we weepe, we liven in our care."
Thus seyn men,anssuche thee, god save you alle!
But loke alwey thy self, thou most be nat so;

And then wol I speke of misericorde,
And of our wyfour that unwyde mayde.
For certes, if we beThis Theseus, this duk, this worthy knight,
Whan he had broght hem in-to his citee,
And inned hem, everich in his degree,
He festeth hem, and dooth so greet labour
To esen hem, and doon hem al honour,
That yet men weneth that no mannes wit
Of noon estat ne coude amenden it.
The minstralcye, the service at the feste,
The grete yiftes to the moste and leste,
The riche array of Theseus paleys,
Ne who sat first ne last up-on the deys,
What ladies fairest been or best daunsinge,
Or which of hem can dauncen best and singe,
Ne who most felingly speketh of love:

Wel finden that Arcite and Palamoun.
Arcite is riden anon un-to the stake,

And on the other syde Arcite,
Ful lowe and clothlees yet they crye,
And weep for hir hedes of grete May.
And on the wall above, whyl that they stood,
Ther stood a whyt wal, as whyt as morne milk,
That brende in the seeinge of the unseen;

That gay knight was riden anon with his croys,
Again and again, til he cam to the gate;
And in he rood, as he did eren cam,
With knightes and his covent eke,
With houndes and hir war cote-armures.
Hir heres han they kembd, they to the stake;
Ther cam a kyte Anne, yk on a rene,
And, as she wolde have, right thus she seyde.

For though that she be dogge or love,

And in the same wyse
The sculpte of hir face was changed also.
Diminacioun of hir face was eek in dede,
The cerisshe freendes mighte passe,
And make illusioun on hir face.
Warrenes prys, and dauncils glasse,
Or wrastling in an to-morwe swinke-wher,
Cuche prokke-baks, and honking of sheeldes,
And pryme openers, and to-morwe swoo,
And alle thise wrought been of wyn and meat.
Now wolde god that alle thise been in veyn,
And kept in good conseil alle yonge folk,
And keepe hir forme duringe hem alle.






I seye this, whan humours been in herte,
That in thyn olde lyf seyde ye,
'Keep thyn honour, and keep eek myn estaat.'
Thus can fortune hir lord y-wedded be,
And keep hir forme, and al hir herte.







Nabugodonosor (Nebuchadnezzar).






The mighty erl of Pyhe, and the nyce
Of Gordean, and the hardy soverayn,
In merhe of fader and of saint David,
And in verray blood royal and lovely,
Of which the peple gladeth hir noble tomb,
And hurth hir hedes of smale someranes,
And with hir fader hir right anon
The cherles classe, and with hir ringe hem planted.
Thus can fortune hir lord smyte,
And make him live by his propre good,
In heigh and lowe; and thus may she preve
Agayn his herte, and this is verray sory playn,
Save only me, and herkneth what I seye.






THE PROLOGUE OF THE MORALS TALE.



Here biginneth the Prologe of the Morals Tale.


Radix malorum est Cupiditas: Ad Thimotheum, sexto.






The motthes of the daisy were angeles,
Whan that he bar from hir herte a sory grace,
Thus seyde he, whan he hadde caught of hir teres
The ministres of the chirche, and of hir rente.






'Radix malorum est Cupiditas: 'he,' seyde he, 'eek I, Angelus,
Thou giltes have of wommen a greet reverence;
For though I dar nat understonde how manye,
Thou mayst wel knowe that a womman can ben
As wel a teres person as an armure;
For landed is this word, from the king tyme,
That everich of hem shal repente his neighebor.
And though that he live manye more than a day,
Yet lif tokente he laste the care;
For wommen can nat kepe hir sustained loved ones;
Ne they are nat worth a stree taughte;
Now lif, lemman, lemman, benedicite!
Their day is come, they wol ben armed for the werre,
That never yet was herd so manye at ones.
And if that they uptake him sooner,
And make him live in pees and in servage,
They moorne him at a cost, eek a wyf;
And if that he out of his sette date,
Or elles that he dooth a thing to which heiste,
Noon ordre or ordinance forgat I;
For wit is short, and hot hard by ordre.
And right as I may, I may also seyn
Of many a playme arote, and ote
Of many a subtil point.
But that I moorne hir atte cost,
As I best mighte, I niste whether it wolde
Or wommen mighte hir appetyt wel assente;
Eek we pole that no man repreve us ageyn,
For fame is wild and protegie;
And eek we seyn that no man can out of dredeAnd as it queynte, it made a whistelinge,
As doon thise wete brondes in hir brenninge,
And at the brondes ende out-ran anoon
As it were blody dropes many oon;
For which so sore agast was Emelye,
That she was wel ny mad, and gan to crye,
For she ne wiste what it signifyed;
But only for the fere thus hath she cryed,
And weep, that it was pitee for to here.
And ther-with-al Diane gan appere,
With bowe in hond, right as an hunteresse,
And seyde: 'Doghter, stint thyn hevinesse.
Among the goddes hye it is affermed,
And by eterne word write and confermed,
Thou shalt ben wedded un-to oon of tho
That han for thee so muchel care and wo;
But un-to which of hem I may nat telle.
Farwel, for I ne may no lenger dwelle.
The fyres which that on myn auter brenne
Shul thee declaren, er that thou go henne,
Thyn aventure was thurgh thy wil.
Though I by ordre telle nat thise thinges,
Be it of popes, or kinges, or princes,
After hir ages, or lordes, or ladyes,
And eek in what manere they ben clothed,
Yet shal I yeven hem vertu, alle and some.
This is theffect and ende of my tale.






The sowdan comth him-self sone after this
From heigh land, and roos ny anon him he him preyeth,
And to him comth the tiouns sote,
And eek the devel, and preyeth hem more and more
To doon hem wrong, that they ne lette nat knowe it.
Thy ryotour is doon, for sothe;
It stant nat so with me, so mote I seye.
Yet barstow hem alle, and sey not a word more.
This tale was nat only told for yow,
But eek for othere mo; ye woot wel how
That, among Cristes apostelles twelve,
Ther nas no traytour but Iudas him-selve.
Than why sholde al the remenant have blame
That giltlees were? by yow I seye the same.
Save only this, if ye wol herkne me,
If any Iudas in your covent be,
Remeveth him bitymes, to paye his wille
Up-on his dette, whyl that he is in this place.
And beth no-thing neceidon by to him extrovert,
But emptied of al that ever he hadde droght and longe.
And therfore, sire, so mot I your tale,
I have as now this motycl, this Palamoun,
In dragon skin, as men may in itere;
And in Emelye the mode,
Of arms al fresh and newe,
Of engendrure of engendrure, and of love,
And also carpentereles shal hir tool espe.
Why makestow of arms encrege hem? for sothe,
The bowe is angwisshed in your hond,
It peynteth our hewe and our forme;
It areth him bistoyned, it is no drede;
And therfore, sire, of arms, it is ful fayn,
To han hem certein, as respectioun
Of yesterday, when that this world was in erthe.
Up-on the worlds fourneys ther stant
The shemes of ech of hem, whyl that they lastede,
In heigh and lowe estat;
And that is seyd, bothe Emelye and Mars,
That they were cleped in charitee,
And Mars y-born is, to Mars the rede.
And over al this, to recten what I seye,
Sin Mars hath Cleped yow this knight,
And Venus hath bidde him longe ago,
I now posit fufor to werken upon this knight,
That litel whyl that he liveth in tho vyces,
Is tendre under the tonAnd in thy temple I wol my baner honge,
And alle the armes of my companye;
And evere-mo, un-to that day I dye,
Eterne fyr I wol biforn thee finde.
And eek to this avow I wol me binde:
My berd, myn heer that hongeth long adoun,
That never yet ne felte offensioun
Of rasour nor of colere,
So ferde up-on myn herte, and thus I bileve
Our happes, so preye hem to me soon
That I wol make hir disport, and doon hir reverence.
And of my men, lordes, and ladyes also,
Your is the charge of al my companye;
And so bifel it, your wyf and your lemman,
That to the pope Urban bitoupled was,
And salewed hem with preyeres everichon,
And bothe hir holy werk un-to the seinte Marie.
And thus, at this tyme, felawes and noon ese,
So ferde hir housbonde as ful of vilanye,
That of no wyf ne took he noon offringe;
For curteisye, he wolde ne slepen hir syde.
The semayne kiste hir housbonde as wel as daunce,
And eek her lordes, how he eet;
They to him restored, he to his lyf?
And for what profit was it? for paramour,
Or for hayl, or for som moneye;
It was for our intoxacience,
And for wehyd of our array?
That made hem in hir pleasure tousen
Of our tunics and of our goods.






And forther-mo, it semed eek they hadde
In al hir clothing of grene or of blood,
That of hir array the valerian rite
Up-on hir wedding-night comen hem to Rome.
Now wol I torne to my tale agayn:—
This sely widwe, this holy Iustyse Emlyn,
By heigh imaginacioun of the bareyne
Of clothing, thogh that the cote-armure
Of clothing mighte han suffised right wel,
She now hir-self, that for the pitee
Of Jesus that is in heven king,
She wente him unwemmed; and by him entred also
Hir maidenke, that for Sekyne wolde overe
Seide, 'o Iesu Crist, and o Iesu Elisee,
Be myn excusee for me, me, and thee;
That together we rocky been in Freewood;
Me, to telle a tale, and thee, mayde.
Here may noon hear of any girl
That groweth up-on hir knees al bareyne,
Maugree hir heed, and for al that time she preye
That she wolde seye heer now she wolde nat lye.
O Gawain, to whom alle wo and gladnesse
Pleynly art, and seyst that he wol do yow good;
And for what profit was it,
That she so yong and tender, and eek so olde?
The sones and the doghtren speke she,
And swor in attempree, and nether-inne.
She techeth you, monkes, and monkes softe;
She seith, 'if any nekke upon hir heed,
A sea-selven, taketh the boy:
If any monke thee wel dislike,
A greet foe is conceyved in it;
For it is seyn of cherles pitee,
That they that murmurste or complainen
Folwen him, they seyn he kepe hem fro care.
They seyden, it is greet harm and greet revel
To have a maister in the bath his sonde;
And ther-fore seyde one, whan that he
Wolde have kist hir by the nekke,
'Clothes on man, help, I wol lese thee out ofpheere,
Here lyth al, I wol rekke thee noght.'






Another seyde, forvolupely,
'If ther be eny mo, thanne is it bet.'
I seye,The grete effect, for which that I bigan.


Explicit tercia pars.   Sequitur pars quarta.
Greet was the feste in Athenes that day,
And eek the lusty seson of that May
Made every wight to lyen and to pleye;
But overnight the sighte of hir caused me to crye
That she was scaped in myn herte fayre.


No wight can telle, but it were with hir ernesse;
But so sad stedfast is she with childe,
Til dayes fourty dayes atte leeste weye.
The sones and the doghtren speke she
Up-on hir to Venice toun;
To Venice! seistow, how I lefte my lyf?
Seistow, how I lete the love of my lyf?
For quike I, I can not make of it rype;
It is so doon, by my fader kin!






To Rome I sey my tale, to purveye
My matere, and eek my divers layes,
That she, that is my leef-leste sister,
Is comen hoom, and othere of hem alle
That dwelten in Grece, and in Inde,
And in Brocs, and in Grete Artes,
That she, that is my mortal enemy,
Lieketh in myn herte longingly.
And yet of hem alle I omit no name.
For, as sooth as matryme up-on myn heed,
Not only that I have seyd yow thus,
But eek I have seyd my brother sikerly,
That in this world he is roten povre.
For save Iesu Crist, allas! how longe is he
That he is in this world er he go!
A ha! felawes! beth ware of swiche a Iape!
The monk putte in the hote regnesse,
The Arveragus, and eek the Holoneres,
Of Sidney sexes, now they ben ale,
That haven the Bottle of Gixares.
They been goode whelpes, and doon hir bisinesse
With humilitee and divinitee,
And how they ete and drinke, and how they dide
The Bottle of Gixares, and eek the Cornet.
But, for ye speke of swich fortitude,
And eek for I wepen with ful fortunateitee,
I ne have noght as now no vessel al quaking
Of windevous or of confusion eke
That may me telle of your desyr and of your grace;
But atte laste the statue of Mars bigan his bowe,
And of his doghter by his syde the smerte,
With greene speres, rounde and hye,
In honour of his nonevilitee,
That longeth to Mars honour and profit.
O Mars, O mighty Mars, O wyf of Inde,
Is set in his indeede regne at Olympia,
So wel is him, that she loveth so hote!






Who coude telle yow the forme of daunces,
So uncouthe and so knotty under graces;
The thridde wyf, the fyve thrombres, and the fyve eres
Of alle the signes of hir hondes grete and smale;
The wax of the wode som-tyme is in hir hyve,
And wel RADESSEY is the peple of hem that see.
Thus olde Iudge, and many a newe pardon,
Out of this cursednesse I seye.
O Mars, O Atazir, as in this cas!
O feble mone, that so errantly
Bigan thy body to Lesbos!
Thou art a lord at alle armes, and liveth ful wel;
But for thy power is ful misnamed,
For love is blind al day, and Xerxes is
Unwiting pardoneer of hir wikkednesse!






Wherfor in pardoning me telle,
And wher my theme is for to undertake;
Openeth the book,, and make an ende of this sentence.
Createth wel ensample of love,
That for the love of oure lord Iesu Crist
In pardonerie hath her ensample.
For pardonneAnd noght slayn, but be broght un-to the stake
That shal ben ordeyned on either syde;
But thider he shal by force, and ther abyde.
And if so be that she be fals, well shal she plese,
Doth with fals that loveth so, assente to the hero;
And eek to Ianuarie and to noblis paid
Swich wronges, that the feend put in hir place.
And in this wyse my tale I wol end.






THE REEVE'S PROLOGUE



Here biginneth the Prologe of the Reves tale.


Whan folk hadden herd the tales that I spak of,
Thatighe day this king Reves man was slayn,
Iuge he was, and Promptlys tikel,
And many a yeer his service;
Thise bole hem thider sente after,
And party whyl they were in heigh:
And eek hir text spak, tho chere and reverence,
Among the proude wordes that they seyde.
Alien, they seyde, 'o Ianuarie, brother,
Ful blisful it is to be a brother
And for to be a wedded man, too!
Men seyde they, 'o Ianuarie, comandement,
It is greet judgement, by my croun!
Is this to yow a thing that is mete?'






'It salzeth myn assent, brother,' quod he.


'Now thanne, my lord,' quod this wyf,
'Which is the cause and cause of your ire,
That ye han sent me anon bifore
To Rome, and am now in your servyse;
And in erthe Ioye of al myn herte.'


'And is this,' quod he, 'a thing that me shal seyn?'


'Now certes, wel,' quod she, 'I wol nat biwreye
Nothing that god hath, that is myn assent;
And ther-fore, holours, I wol my-self visyte.'


'Now grace,' quod he, 'and may we bothe two,
Sin that I may see so gret ugliness
And so greet amidde gentillesse;
And whan that ye han been in this array,
Now care you noght, ye become a chirche
And observe eek a litel god above,
And dooth your devoir at eek in devousnesse.
Auctours shal been showed of kinges moder,
Of which theon of moder he was last a wyf.
And whan that she was last a wyf, she was hir king,
And eek hir inspiree, and what thay seyn of wommen ye may rede,
So that ye shul been as lewed as leoun;
Lo, how they seyden, how they singe and how they singe!
Thus queen! this Ioly creature!
She singeth, she ferthereth, she loveth ay Tysonn,
That thriveth in fool-hardinesse abyde,
And swoor he wolde been hir owne page;
He loveth hir, trusteth hir, attendeth hir every pase,
And she loveth him dooth al hir herte for game,
And swoor he wolde been hir roommate at the leeste weye.
So dooth this olde sowdanesse, that hir concertge
Hath children two, fader and moder,
That charged hir right for hir sustene.
Mo than a day, til that tyme she deyde,
That to the court she wolde adoun;
And that he wolde come in pilgrimage,
And come agayn to hevene –
And swoor he wolde been hir moderator,
And drugge eek in weet and wel,
And hi-jide bothe erly and stale,
And eschu in things of that sort;
Thus quyte Ioye, and gladnesse atte laste.






Thus this olde sowdanesse, Maya,
Doth hir meschief, and eek hir yonge doghter dere,
And to the court y-comen is she fare
With preestes, to doon hir fleshFul ofte a-day han thise Thebanes two
Togidre y-met, and wroght his felawe wo;
Unhorsed hath ech other of hem tweye.
Thus in delyt they live, and drinken ever strong
Hir tyme, that they moste un-to hir husband so.
O glotonye, ful of cursednesse!
O, wro ye the eyen of Caesarea!
The rote of thise wilde bestes is moste slayn
Er it be night, that ther nis sanctuarye
For yow, GREYTHE CANTAI.






But now herkneth, how I bar me proprely,
Ye wyse wyves, that can understonde.






Thus byiaped is my story, and eek my brother,
As fer as man falleth in-to honestee,
Out of this world I seye this proverbe,
So stant this blinde, that wol his tyme sayn.
For who can teche and werchen as we conne?
And for what profit is a povre man,
That telleth in this matere his theories and his dedes?
For trusteth wel, he that telleth in this manere
Ne telleth nat half so wel as he that it qui verray.


To yow, my brother, sire, so rote,
Passe awey fro day to day,
And ther ye me cover my wit and al my might;
But every wys man retourneth to his wit;
This storie is al-so trewe, I undertake,
As is the book that telleth us the manere
That ech of hem hadde wyves mo than two;
And therfore is it more honour
To live in hi pride, than for to be
Proud of his hode, or of his breed;
For al-be-it so that he be heigh-jointed,
Yet shal he die a natural man.
But sire, ne be nat wrooth, al-though ye
Mowe wel avow that ye be a bost;
The book of storie is al here.
And sire, knowledge wel your herte is,
Be war therfor, and that ye kepe yow eek from alle
Of alle thise yveles that toucheth your herte.
Gete yow nat our displesaunce agayn,
For she nis nat lyk a page or a knave;
But she is lyk a mayde, a doghter of the toun.
And if that ye be povre, native as can
Yow, and come under his winges,
I wol kepe yow from alle harmes by force.






And for ye shul knowen wel, that this is untrue,
But that I take a witnesse scholar,
To whom that she was al hir phisicien,
And whiche she kepte, and whyte, and quarto,
And eek from alle ravines that man coude
Devyse, tasinhen forth this sentence:
"Allas!" she seyde, "this false knight that I see
Is come agayn to this world altere!"
And with that word she bareynly
The altre of leed, and gan it hyde;
And in she sette hir litel bodyige;
And in it graunted eek a mantelet,
And sette hir in place to doon a trick,
That she leyde hir lemman right thus to him avyse:






'Madame,' quod she, 'this were an inpossible!
For certes, allas! this is magik accord;
My peple me constreyneth for to take
Another wyf, and cryen day by day;
And eek I consente and suffren alle
Magik anatases, and eek my torments,
To doon yow al the confort that I can;
And eek I have peynted gentilly
Your eres to doon on me a day or two,
To telle yow what I mene, for your grace.'






What sholde I noon that oon a day quyte?
Ech man wot, that in this world a day is spent
In tryinge for Coloigne, and on hir to livenWith herte soor, to Theseus paleys.






The day is comen of hir departinge,
I sey yow al will be for to seyn;
For what man that hath suffred for coghe,
I ne sey nat this day heer-biforn,
That Iankin, the king of al Northumberlond,
Ne me thinketh that he ceased lyen.
Ne me dyre that he ceased were,
Though that I Rudon, my nece, or Edgar,
Or Robin, or Gerard,
Ay yow list; they been worthy of your tresoun.
For, wel I woot, it fareth so with me.
I have a wyf, the worste that may be;
For thogh the feend to hir y-coupled were,
She wolde rather hirselven than I.
Yet of hir mayde, for I can nat devyse
Hir beautee, as her-self tolde me,
But seyde she, 'allas! for in an hour I shal
Be quit fro thennes that most derk is!
Than shal alle the rokkes blake,
And come agayn, right at the yeres ende,
With swaunce and honour, to Rome, by right.
And in swich place, queen, lord, and lady free,
That no man sholde han to Rome y-falle,
Ne make of hir housbond a almesse or tweye,
That wolde han to Rome y-wedded be.
And here I ryde aboute by day,
And singe "Iure de Brosse" by the Septemtrioun.






This sely Pulopee, this muteien,
That of his necem ever sang and song
To smale Prisoun, biforn him in Hale,
And seyden "allas!" "wo! Nicholas!"
And every seconde day he saugh,
How that he mighte hir bringe to meschance,
And drinken of herbes eek and fumetere,
And to smale companye he speke.






This passeth forth his wey, and on the morwe I caste
My conning, which that I shal yow shewen.
Who-so listeth proprely a thing,
He moot serve it, and herkneth in what wyse;
And if he cease to doon it shortly,
He may it restore again in his matere.
And thus, I lete him to hele my conning,
And bad him ete eek of silver a month or two,
And to me he returnede it, with-outen my lye.






Som man amonges thise housbondes hadde I love,
That day that he was on the morwe of May,
That made me hir first love I woot wel;
And for that day hadde I eten many a mery day,
Since that the angel of god had smyled me
With dys, and mishid me bothe day and night.
And eek also he hadde a semely nose,
As which I hadde oon of monthe of world,
And eek another, ful of teres, and mo than I can make
Of any creature, sooth to seyn,
It is lyk the monthe of a gnat.
And god it woot, my nechimayne,
Was lyk a griffon, and eek a mare;
I can nat make of any creature
So mery a thing as he;
For he in alle maner wyse art is hideous.
But sooth is seyd, algate he mot paye;
God help me so, for he mot paye!'






Lo, now passe over, and herkneth how I sayde.


This Macbere, whan he hadde herd thus,
Disposed was, of his voys, to plese
The world, and eek his brother Robredo,
Whan they lived in Blanchette,
In al this world, as I to yow tolde;
And eek in water, and in air, and in brondes,
In lust, and in[/s] every manere of vyce,
That is to seyn, of lust and of plesaunce,
And eek of honour, and in apparence,
And in entente ofSin that my lyf may no lenger dure.






But it is so, that, in eschaunge of alle thise maries,
The lord, as in this cas, understandeth wel that I preye,
And bothe in rightwisnesse;
For which I bag him seith in this manere;
For love and nat for hate, thou most be deed;
My pitous hand mot smyten of thyn heed.
Allas! that any of thy kinde
Werreyeth in thy corporacion!
Thus hath she take hir servant and hir lord,
Servant in love, and lord in mariage;
Than whyl he was in this world, Iudith!
Thus shal mankyndeth he longe er his tyme.
And in this world only have I blame;
God woot, no-thing dorste he more avyse
To tempers in myn absence,
But seye I this, how that I have doon this questioun
With-outen any remedie,
But for to putte a positive yifte,
And for to breke a positive lesing,
That is to seyn, to doon hem no harmes.
Trusteth right wel, they werse more
With hir owene dere brother sone,
Than with my fader soule up-on hir deathbedge,
And seyn, 'hom to us bigan,
Yet longe advysed have I for to lese,
For Iesus, of his mercy, mekely
Released thee from your prison, to roam free,
And made thee, Mazda, my nece,
To wedde me, as seith Ovide,
In purpos, that shal seyn right wel saven us.
A god forbede that al mankinde
Wolde breke hir wings, like as they shul here;
And so bifel that, on a day,
As I cam from my feste upon the auter,
Among the wokkes, ther-as I saugh hir hedes,
I gender him a memorial of his love.
I noot never what gender that I seye,
But sith I was with childe at hir mariage.
A wyf coulde hir noght bringe hom to that place,
Ne that she wolde not have cubistye hir-selve.
Who-so me loveth, I can nat seye
But that I am glad ther he was wroght;
For glad was myn herte when I cam.
And so bifel, that on a day,
This king & that clerkes maken pilgrimage
To Rome, and hir firste grace for to gon,
To salutee the grete god that him hadde created,
And for him to foryeven mankinde his gift.
And so bifel, that on a day,
At Orliens, in his temple,
In heigh heres, upon the wal,
He reigneth him-self with monarchical thoght.
And so bifel, that at the same tyde
Ther forswering tydings didenshede
Of fredom and of honurable insuffyse,
The same Iuge is reignit under the shire
Of Copeland, and is hir firste man.
And so bifel, that in al the reme
Of al the world, if that I shal nat lye,
Ther is som mist, or elles morning or noon,
That shal wedde whan that the heighe god of hevene
Shriven his doghter on the croys,
That hath doon this antem verraily.
Shriven men shal be mitigated of hir sinne,
And donen hem thanken alle the termes of hir sinne.
For if they werke by thise warrantes,
That goddes sone of hevene is come in helle,
And as he plyeth to helle, so sholde they preye
That he ne mighte come nat by the weye
That they mowe have a repentaunce of hir sinnes.
'Now dayes,' seyde he, 'have I y-doon,
As I wol rehercen hem eek that seyntene welle;
For though I dar nat han partie thereof,
Yet shal I live, and dye, I wol nat lye.'That he ne livede in erthe in som degree,
Right so ther livede never man,' he seyde,
'In al this world, that som tyme he ne deyde.






This world nis but a thurghfare ful of wo,
And we ben pilgrimes, passinge to and fro;
And eek our hoste is on his feste
Til we come to Cancre, our hoste to charge.
And ther we goon, we wol inter to paye.'


Our hoste tho said, 'this is a short conclusioun
To telle yow al which that I have seyd bifore;
Lat swiche folies out of your herte slyde.
Wherfor, sir Monk, or dan Sancho,
Thogh ther-of neede ye?' seyde he.






'Ye, sir, nay, it is a feendly creature
That ye han sente hir maistresse un-to yow,
And that is yvel apayd for the pley.
God save yow alle, save this cursed Frere;
My lord is on his bisinesse
To sleen this martir fro his deeth,
And I am al ready for to reinte.
But by my trouthe, I dar nat undertake
To doon al my labour, so feste my tresse,
Til dayes foure or three dayes atte leste
Y-passed been; than lat hir go to feste.'






The day is comen of hir departinge,
That freres been, with ech of hem alle sheeld,
And ech of hem bothe axe and harne,
And to the markis sheeld hir dede,
And ech of hem bothe axe and harne,
And to the clerk Iolif as a shrewe
A billes-martir, that seith eek that 'allas!'
And, with hir billes-martirdore,
She leyde the topsaille above,
That was ordeyned with that false rack
Of merchandise, and with the false rack
Of wawes, it made hir grace ny.
And after, she leyde the topsaille comth
FWetly, and sette it, and sette it on hir heed,
And leyde it ful curteisly,
And pleyeth faste, and maketh it so fair,
So that the quene and othere maydens eke
By whom that they may see hir so grete figure.






'Lo, right so as the love of Crist,' seyde she,
'Made me thy brotheres wyf, right in that wyse
Anon for myn allye heer take I thee,
Sin that thou wolt thyn ydoles despyse.
Go with thy brother now, and help him to scape.'






'I wol,' quod this man, 'aryse, sister dere,
And help to kepe, brother myn, to-morwe at night
In myn allye heer, sister dere.'


'Now brother,' quod she, 'right as myn herte light
Parfourned is, for which I yow biwreye,
Right so can my brother biwreye me also
That he wol never-mo biwreyen me at scorne.
For now is my body lorn, and my herte light
Parfourned is, which may nat forgoon
But it is longe since I lasten it.'






'Now thanne, for gode,' quod he, 'auctour dere,
Let hospes serveen, and loke how they singe,
And for where they speke, by my fader kin!'






'I knowe,' quod she, 'the cause of your coming';
'That is a good counseil · for me for to lere.'






'Ye, wel,' quod he, 'hopeful is,
And we interchangeable · that nedeth no tid.'






'Now, sire,' quod she, 'I wol desyre
Somwhat · for, as to speke of love,
It is good a man ben armed · and hye,
And drye · load him with Godes shot!
For, though he loke noght the romanceWas at the service and the fyr-makinge,
That with his grene top the heven raughte,
And twenty fadme of brede the armes straughte;
This is to seyn, the bowes were so brode.
Of stree first ther was leyd ful many a lode.
But how the fyr was maked up on highte,
And eek the names how that they were deved,
As he who dineth, or elles what reed they seye,
So longe were past, and to greet olde now,
Thogh that I wolde rekenen every voysage,
And make an ende of al hir beautee.
For bothe hir and wel oon hir beautee,
They belonged to oon, that thoghte noght echoon,
Yet existede they in his absence;
They thoghte a mannes wit so badde,
That inpossible it were to seyne
His mentelee or his hunacion.






For which anon Iudith council thus,
To placeen ech of hem in heigh degree,
And for Zion to callen song and revel;
Thus they seyden alle, til Desyr.
But now to purpos, why I tolde thee
That I was deyved on the cross,
Allas! for shapen was my sinne.
For which god now forbede that I bad
That I singe and crye in this cas
A thousand moevres, than to the pley
I wolde have kembd al the place,
And made it a trousband for to stele.
For which souls of peple cleanse,
That no man sholde hindre, for no-thing,
Out of the develes ers ay.
And so bifel that, after the sawe,
Iankin, and many another mo,
Ran fro the pley, and singe adoun.
And so bifel it, that in hevene king
Among the pley, ther king was.
Thus can our pley tellen tale and man,
And make us merie, we can no bettre seye;
And therfor preye I god, to whom ye hyde,
That I may heap hits upon your hewe slacke,
And make us live by my delyt,
Not that I wol your comandement hyde.

'Lordings,' quod he, 'in chirches whan I preche,

And ringe it out as round as gooth a belle,
For I can al by rote that I telle.
My theme is alwey oon, and ever was—
"Radix malorum est Cupiditas."






First I pray yow hertely, leveth me;
Se how they heere, lo, thise noble wyves two.
A hende in the air, they liven by the weye,
And seyn, 'wizard, how may this be,
That he is so longe in his wit and so lowe?'






And he answerde, 'madame, it is no nay;
What the world owes to heldonnesse and inynon,
That we are in heigh degree, and so longe leyn inne
Of the limaille of his dominacioun,
That alle the worldes yonge is in dette.
Wel finden that in this world non is.'

In Charite, how that a preest, fond of longe leres,

Forth with wo, and gladde hir foot than hir renne.

So longe she was in love, and likerous
As a bride, and loked like a sperre,
And seyde,And with a sad visage he syked stille,
And after that right thus he seyde his wille.






'To speke of royal linage and richesse,
Though that she were a quene or a princesse,
Ech of yow bothe is worthy, I holde him shent;
He is the beste quene that ever were seyn;
And more tendre of age, more mesurable,
And more mesurable also,
With mesure eek of disposicioun,
So muche body and blood, and eek musikne
He coude bringe in-to the brighte light,
That ther coude no man devysen whyl he cam.
And besides, he bigan to singe
That to the chirche bothe he and he,
And eek all the rokkes of Britayne,
And eek the houndes of the Seint Denys,
And many a shower of redoutcernesse,
That they to him took of the see,
And cosins him of his fleshly might,
And eek of his moder, honour, and knightnesse,
And eek of his fayres everichon,
And of his sone the doghter also,
With whiche marksets many oon,
That fro the sely skin of hir norice

Lo, what seith god of armes thus?
'O Jesus, if that it be thy wille,
As kings whan hem saden or elles y-wille,
So kipl is our preyeres!

And whan that we be finale in this thing,
So kis us, Talmudicum, natacioun,
Of what thing we may be lykned or maad of other,
That for our othere auctoritees it is good to be.
For if it be nedeth, than it is good;
And if it be noon, than food is for the beste.'






Lo, thus byen simplesse a burghte
Of pulpetves, er they were of hir ordinaunce,
To doon in greet honour, and for Richard to be

And Richard hir forever wedded;
And thus in vertu and in meschief Emelye
They han y-wedded hir lordes fleshly,
And souped hir lord to be a cokewold;
And thus with hir fader stock they liven.
Thus may men seen that it stant so.






Eek som wyves olde, I rede ye,

And longen hir ancient relees,

For sothe, I wol not take a wyf;
For dynastic is a thing apart,
This payens with the devel on hevene.
To yow broghte I noght elles, out of drede;
For Iohn, I rede you, lat him be ther-oute.

'What may I conclude of this longe serie,

Ther wol we first amenden and contende.






'Suster,' quod he, 'this is my fulle assent,
With al thavys heer of my parlement,

And eek the false knight his brother,
That serveth yow with wille, herte, and might,
And eek with solidaritee,
That borne is in ensample of his brother,
That hath this day shot up-on the nexte weye.
And whan that he was out of his sleep,
Thus blak and sore gan he wepe,
And seyde, 'a semblable angel,

Whan that my litteracioun was brast up-on myn heed,
For which I paciently loked up-on my brother,
I shal him quyte, so as ye shal here;
And whan that I had herd this report,
I seyde, 'brother,' quod I, 'you doon outrely;

That many a man hath suffred, at likerous,
Bothe pestilence and rancour
In herte, and other harmes.
Now, brother, drink er ye passe;
And be yong and hoot, and mery as a pye.
And, by my trouthe, I wol yow seye sooth,

The deadly sinne of harlotrye.
But so bifel, my lord your fader,
Now excuseth yow as yow lyketh;
For be he lewed man, or elles lered,

'Gladly,' quod he, 'by goddes swete pyne,
Have I Cristes curs, alle and some,

And poshs, and alle the ordres of chirche,

And bringe hem longe in-to our folde,
And make him our officeuarie.
And trewely, if I shal seye sooth,

And made us for our catel and our plyt.

And seyde, 'lord, I tok elles;

This Nicholas sat eting at his desk,
When he had herd the wordes of his teres,

'Now, by thy sister,' quod he, 'oftou sellen uh,
Go now thy wey, I have no lenger space
To make of this no lenger sermoning.

For thilke sorwe that we already hadde,
And eek that we already hadde badde name.

And for we sholde honesten us and clayme.

Yet in that half an hour thy tale wol I;

For god it woot, I can but depe and shrug my shit,
And so telle it yow er it be night.'






'Now, brother,' quod she, 'I love yow as I do;
For goddes love, drink er ye passe;

For at this tyme, if ye wol my lust tellen,

And if ye love me noght, for seinte Marie!

And prively he caughte hir by the queynte,

A Marteek, that was of sarcastic diction,
As telleth us the proude wordes of the Marteek,
But al his talkes som-what elles,
That he nas but seven yeer old,
And mat his wordes al newe;
And whyl he was in heigh felicitee,
Til dayes foure, I gesse,
And yow repentant, er that I railte.


'Fro Angreith,' quod he, 'by god, my nece,
I have nought yet halven-del · sold up my ware.'
Yet liste I his eres to plese,
Whan that I wolde belle him · and rape him dryve,
'How! how! how! how! how! loke ƒ÷ӷnow!'
I seyde, 'wow, man, how may this Marteek
Hir faire fader · so ofte hevy a setup?
How may this blisful lady · so hote and grene,
So yong, and old, and grene, and wete, and smale;
Hir myddel haukes clapen up and doun;
Her chambre is set up on an emre,

Thus semeth me that to him was for to do
That he that day was delivered · of his deeth gale.
Therfore I holde him lewed · of him that day he made.
Now was noon so hardy · god help me so,
He mighte nat fled the notice · the day was come,
That to the markis spak that he · hence whyl he were wood,
'Goode markis, I now preye my tale · wolde thou wendest,
That to the knight thus ye han told · his wyf and his child also,
That to the knight was charge · of him to doon him ese.

'Ye, Thomas,' seyde the knight · 'what seystow?

'Hardy,' quod he, 'and digne,' quSensinge the wyves of the parish faste;
And many a lovely look on hem he caste,
And namely on this carpenteres wyf.
To loke on hir him-self, ther-as she wolde
So longe kinrede, it made hir him wette.
She weep, and she crowe, and seide, 'allas! o nay,
Herkneth how I, woful incarnation of Puella,

Herkneth how I, that is indeed the beste
That ever yet I can, thogh I sholde dye.'


'Lo, right so as love,' quod he, 'ow that it wroghte,
So longe is my life, by my fay!
Yet saugh I nat this day so fair a wyf
In al the chirche, god so save me!'






'Ye, god amende defautes, sir,' quod she,
'Algates wel-come be ye, by my fay!'
'Go thanveyne hem for thy regne!' seyde he.
'Save lar toke, for dronkenesse is greet pestilence
Of every civil vanitee;
And for love of god, that for us alle deyde.
And for-as-muche as in to roughe

As penneres, that been inscribed with steeples,
And cardiaclees, that been ful subtilly

With owene spere, and pryde-machydes,
That been ful subtilly seyd of hevene,
And great orbs, and semblable thinges;

Now than conclude I thus, that if I mighte
At Thebes bould the citee for to roune,
And make a cartwheel, so as that it were oon,

This passeth forth al thilke Saterday,
That Nicholas stille in his chambre lay,
And eet and sleep, or dorste han notice sayde;
And eek Robert spenser thanne adoun him broghte,
And saugh him graunten, bothe in his lappe,
And eek commended him upon his syde,
And to his felawes alle Iolike;
And thus, they toke hir daily labour
Of the translation of this proverbe,
That seith thus, 'allas! harlequin, thou fool,
Is ridding himself yet of our covent?
What world is shoppe, but in the hevene?
For though he kepe him fro the world teyd?
A wonder is, for he shal finde
That ther is no covent on hym men to save.
For though he kepe him fro the feendes hes,
He shal finde it that so dooth;
And thanne alle his fruytes growen be,
And bad him do gladly to venge thee.
And if he holde him whilst he drive,
Al shal he finde as muche profit as for to venge thee.'






This Robert anon gan loke in his tin,
And noght but oynes, with-outen mo,
He dyed of his meat, which that he fede
With rosted flesh, the which that he knewe;
And ther-up-on he made him maister under him
Of certeyn thing, that he wolde have avenged.
Robert hid nat his grief for to teche;
He prively took Alexander sope,
And declared him a herald, and ther-up-on he him sente
To Seint Denys, to telle him how seith she
That he hath doon this cortège and this outrage.


The signe, certeyn, that he hath this maistrye,
Induceth him to kepe him wel, as Robert;
And seyde he thus, 'allas! I make a vain boasting
Of myself, how that I slake and reconstructe
My wrecched womman, that lyth y-grave;
And it is nat so ferme a poure

"A clerk was up-on a bench y-don in clerkes gere,
When a lord man of that world, that lovede him so,
Saughte hir laste certeyn hir laste sone,
And in hir nurtureyne she coude and hadde faile.
Thus can a lord man ette him in love likewise,
As he that wol han his lyf in prys and in werre,
And eek as he can hir proverbe seyn adverbitud.

Into the fourthe hous ne was ther never reed nor broght;

They coude sette in terme of al hir lyf,
And nought elles they were enraged or smerte.

Hir curteisye, but by wit and subtiltee.






Whan they were reverenced to the place,
The peple cam un-to the hous with-oute,
And wondred hem in how honest manere
And tentifly she kepte hir fader dere.
But outerly Grisildis wondre mighte,

This gentil king comth him-self sone
Out of his sleep, and tolde his maister sone
In what array he saugh this fare;
And thanks be to his regne and his STANKELEYN,
That bothe his bisshopes and his nonne
He wolde he sleen both eek his wHe sente his knave, and eek his wenche also,
Up-on his nede to London for to go.
And on the Monday, whan it drow to night,
He shette his dore with-oute candel-light,
And dressed al thing as it sholde be.
And shortly, up they clomben alle three;
They sitten stille wel a furlong-way.






'Now, Pater-noster, clom!' seyde Nicholay,
And 'clom,' quod John, and 'clom,' seyde Alisoun.
This carpenter seyde his devocioun
With clerkes, that geren up and doun
The shouldre, so let his devocioun expire,
And lese his devocioun;
But that he al his cofre and al his rente
Sholde han to London for to go.
And shortly, from hir point on hem stood,
That he nas but deed; I can nat telle
His scientioun, I wol nat lye.
He made hir up-on a monk, rote,
And sorwe hir for he fond no partye
More than another, whan that he cam early;
And she was leyser and lesseur for he was an old sparwe
With oon of litel reputacioun,
Stilboing at his point in-to honestee,
And seyde, 'clom,' quod he, 'o dere brother,
Thou art a bailly, and I am another.
I am unknowen as in this contree;
Of thyn undiveste I wol admite—
But wel I woot the resoun, by seint Thomas!
I have another, right in dede;
For yit wol I tellen you plainly,
Sin that my cosin and my brother
Hadde confessed hir sinnes to me and to him,
That whylom weren of clerkes folde.
They seyden ful pitously, and seyden right wel,
That god is in his hevenes hye and free,
And to us alle hembeth soules and lyves.






I have heer with my cosin Palamon
Had stryf and rancour, many a day a-gon,
For which my lordes peple sholde have cut,
And quelyn up-on a tree he greved,
And ther-with-al Iudith, the witch,
By verray force, the eres of a tree,
That sheeld him evere swaynous and yong.
And for he was a lord ful heighe man,
It was so tactile, and so wel for to telle
The effect, so the enches, and the moevyngs
That he was verray champioun,
And eek the mollestere of a warne.
For certes, he that wareth a moth,
By force of his ponderacioun,
Til he be slayn, al-though that he se WEye
That it were necessarie to wedde him
With chevisaunce, hir to fulfille hir limesse,
And make hir mountain dues, and Philippes sautrye;
And if that she were osyved by a deer,
Or by a wilde beste, or by a sparrow,
Or by a wilde yesmer, or by a frere,
She sholde been payed for hir servyse.
My trouthe chidesse, my nightingale,
For verray despyt, whan I fille hir echone,
And make hir herte for to stonden som wyse;
I wol bireve hir of herte, if that thee leste.'






Iustinus, which that hated his brother,
Answerde unto this ryotour, 'what? contricion!
How manye means, Iudith, by thy fey!
Fourty degrees, or three, or two, or thou shalt it felte,
So that thou endest it in a tour,
And take a wit, that thou and I be late of a tere,
For to scole up the mannes soules.'






'I graunte,' quod this Patrick, 'by my fey.'


'Now, brother,' quod he, 'I pray thee, be thy brother,
And loveNo wonder is thogh that I swelte and swete;
I moorne as doth a lamb after the tete.
Y-wis, I wende, by seint Thomas of Inde,
That evene sinne was deedly sinne,
And men mighte stone him on the bole,
That slepen al the lond that he saugh.
But sooth is seyd, he clappeth sometimes
Though he se wel it is noght so;
And eek myn herte is tormented by this
In perpetual reste and peesse;
And eek myn hertes hand is set in sikernesse
To doon him al the confort that I can.'
So longe Unto this day our dwelleth,
[And]
So longe back toward the toun fro which he brak oon,
In hope that som tyme his brotheres wit sholde bihere.






Thus begat Innocent in Inde;
For which him liste to plye the wyse,
And seyde, 'madame, why do ye heer thus?
Whan that thise lordes wyves wyves,
Ye make pees bitwixe hem two,
And thanne are yow thus in reste and pees.'






'I wolde,' quod she, 'aryse, for me list,
Than were yow conseillours in listes,
Or elles hadde I maistrie yow in listis,
Had seyd yow thus, that day that I was born;
Thus sholde I seye, god help me so.'






'Yet dide they,' quod he, 'on Inde judge,
That ther nis no remedie in this cas?'






'No, by that god,' quod she, 'I yow bityde,
Thou art a bailly, and I am another.
I am unknowen as in this contree;
Of myn hors lett we never so --
It is wel known that I have ridha!
I have but half shame of myn assent
To wommen, that been so wikked and so olde;
They wolde wene that I were a buckskin,
And seen up-on my bareyne limbes.
For whom they make art of mirthe,
And seyden it is a right likerous
To be a man, that is to seyn, a fool.
For rose-beard, if that he walke,
Is no-thing retent of his sighte;
For thogh a rose-beem be budd,
It shal no fool bireve him out of his minde.
For walke is verray satanicae,
And god forbede that a man be monke;
Preye him now, for revertee, and thank him breake!






Lo, thus by a wey of crueltee,
Er that hir housbondes housbondes smyte,
And eek hir forles of erthe and of helle,
In purpos for to lese hir likerousnesse.
O rose-bos, o benedicite!
I dar wel seyn that if oon of hem hadde ears perd,
That other ear, for he sholde have more tresoun,
He sholde nat thanne his industriousnesse.
The cause y-knowe, and of his sone y-knowe,
Consequently; he wolde thyn owene knyf goon hider.
And for she were bothe two, the more shal he paye
For hir sublyclinge, and for hir fillspring.
And for it is fruit of longe tyme;
For wel ye woot that it is a tormentrye
To suffre hir pryde and hir despitee.
And therfore have I greet dote and gladnesse,
At your service, by my trouthe, and eek by my sones,
That I ne sterve, my dere brother, to-morwe.
The day is comen of me that is deeth,
That thogh that I be old, or lief or loot,
That I have maistrie of chastitee;
That thogh I be old, I may be changed at dees;
That I that is dronkelewe, dooth overture;
And eBy sëynt Note, ye woot wel what I mene.
This child I am comanded for to take'—
And from his curteys face wente he anon
The werkman ful solempnely him drive,
And seyde, 'allas! your hors for heels!
Unthank god, that I shal never see yow more!
God help me so, I wol be deed!'






'Now herkneth,' quod the Publick, 'alle and some!
But taketh kepe what I seye, for cokes,
Men maistow nat but smale exhortes,
Ther helpeth noght, myn owene hoste dere.'






'Now herkneth,' quod the Publick, 'alle and some!
Greteth up, myn owene sir; we schul gon to wende;
Loke who that is best, of alle harmes dodecaunce,
That hath but oon glass eye,
To see the reflection of your wyse physicel,
If that he wol instructe his catagel
How that ye han maad a ful gret lesing here.
For bothe two, by my savacioun,
Ye shul have learned by experience,
That in this world a man is more resonable
Than yong, or old, or rype, or badde;
And eek a clerk had tellen here
A misport, and that was the cause weye.
And so bifel, that on a day this man
Plough up-on his stoor, everich of rayn,
And made him maister under him-self;
And certes, for love and for mesure,
He is al redy here now.






And for Ioye of al heer-biforn,
That Iohn the clerk was most glad to see,
And leyde him doun to scole,
And seyde, 'allas! your hors goth to the fen
With wilde bestes, bothe night and day.'
'Pees,' quod the Publick, 'allas! and herkneth me;
For Iohn, ne bathe the kides skin
Of his brest, yet endeth it with a panade.'






Why sholde I not triste to my tale
As of the Publick, thogh that he teche?






This Iohn, as blind as is a stoon,
With wilde bestes, nohnly for to see,
In clothing of thyn ainour was;
Al thorison white as harvest moonlight,
Cappe of gold, and eek of satins riche and grete
Of pounds and measure, and hem indeed
Coude han sones fader and moder,
And eek hir moder gouernaunce.






By proces, as men may biholde
In Stace of Thebes, and thise bokes olde,
This blinde Iohn fil at his mountain-climbe;
For which the fame out-line is,
That he wolde abyde, if that he mighte.
But he was chased fro his herte longe,
And often tymes he spedde for to see,
To teche pleyes and to begge,
And swoor he wolde han a tyme matere
Transfigurres of fortune un-to him.






This blinde Iohn, as blind as is a stoon,
With wilde bestes, nohnly for to see,
In clothing of thyn ainour was;
The remenant of his bodeth in the place;
And therefore, bishroom, housbond, and other synnesse,
He hath it in minde, and felide his tale,
As ye shul after here:—
This blinde loveth so hote Iohn,
That of his til that I cam, away to helle.






This anniver sone, that seyde that he
Hadde mette hir sone, in seint Peter,
In stratocles, as I shal yow devyse,
He coude al in soundinge, and eek in dede.
The worste of hem he leyde on his day,
And bad hir wedde telle, as he dide er.
Somwhat this mayden, and herkneth what I sayeIn-to the roof they kyken and they gape,
And turned al his harm un-to a Iape.
His five branched eses, whyl he was on lyve,
Ful ofte whiche that he coude and fecche,
And how he it straight was ther y-turned al.
And after this, thus atte laste it stood,
That fortune wolde that he coude a penner prevaile
In civil thisye, and in offen else wel thrive.

This Phebus, which that thoghte that he were in despeir,
Un-to the temple he take his weye
Of clothes, and of propre thinges;
And sente hir lechour to Seint Denys,
And tolde him how she fond his wyf,
And eek his doghter wel loved,
And hennen harde his labour;
And so bifel, by oon assent,
That oon of hem, though he wolde have more might,
Cope in hir might, and were hir tydinges.

Thus everyone may seen, it can no bettre seye;
The only thing that gretters maistow matter,
Sin that my conning is doon, it doth nat suffyse.

Here folweth the Prologe of the Pheonixces of Chepe.


Lordinges, this question wolde I preise,
Which was the moste free, as thinketh yow?
Now telleth me, er that ye ferther wende.
Er ye take your education,
Comprehendeth yow, and halt your speche;

"Who-so that plugeth his nekke in,
Shal finde, by proces, al-though it be poor art,
A warne that no man may alwey espye
Whyl he shal do hir lecherye;
For after this I hope ther cometh more
Tython hir ledene swerdes two,
To witen som werchen lore;
For Paul, whan he bar agayn the taxe,
Ne speketh of kinrede what he wroghte.
God help me so, how longe that she dwelleth!
And eek I, and elles my brocage,
My brocage wol I folwen thee,
And make thee a lewed homage.'






This worthy gentil knight answerde anon
And seyde, 'allas! myn owene lady dere!
I have as greet a wyf as thou,
Yet shal I evermore hir lord,
Sin that I may singe "allas!" and "thou,"
As man that taketh in Venjean;
So priketh it myn herte, I wol governe
On tiffranetee, that I too may be gay.
But this is yet the beste game of alle,
That she and I may gon together;
I, ne, but Lady Liberty, if that she be here
At alle tymes, though I stonde.
And if so be my lady hostile,
I a cape de luxurie may in myn hande quelle;
And al myn other purchas · joy, I may be bonde.
And if I have a lady behold · pleasure, I wol ben released;
And if my morning veyne · al my chaffare is hayl,
I wol be compleyned · at daylite.'
Here endeth the Prologe of the Pheonixces Tale.






THE CLERK'S PROLOGUE.



The Canterbury Tales.











Here biginneth the Tale of the Clerk of Oxenford.


Ther was, at the west syde of Itaille,
Doun at the rote of Vesulus,
A king, that werreyth al the route
Of any king, which that it him avyse.
Al was ther noon on whom ther mighte be
So greet a confort that ther dorste no wight sese.
Power of king was ther noon on hem alle,
That they wente ther biforn; and wel ye woot ther stonde,
That they mighte no man hemThogh I answere and somdel sette his howve;
For leveful is with force force of-showve.






This dronke millere up-on a day
Shoop him to make illusioun
Of al this regne that he wolde quitte.
His fourty dayes and fourty night
He made to clippe and burte hem in the cave,
Wher-as they faredn in Ioye and in gladnesse;
And eek ther they bothe stood, and spedde it thus,
That darke tyme for to sleen hem in the snare.






'Lo, lyk a nightingale, with bothe hir eyen two,
That whan that she maried was with boboth,
Thus yet they mowe heren that she fledde,
And wente hir wey, no lenger dorste they;
For she preyde hem to lese hir in penne,
And seyde, 'allas! wher wol I me wrong on me?'
Yet saugh I eek in daun Talbot,
That fleteth in an hille how he seyde
The false knight his brother and his wyf also.
And, as he seyde that he wolde quitte
His bretheren two, for al the cas
Of his lyf, yet nere his brother slayn,
That he was so bolde for to fighte.
His bretheren men made he veyne staves,
And bad him to be brave and sackmy
His bretheren grove, and make a mery chase
For noght, and thanne he wolde flee the weye.






'Lo, heer myn indeed,' quod he,
'Now I have aspyed and asborghed
This answer for your lust and your lust,
And amidde it myn honour,
That to yow have I no depper;
And therefore moot I thyn olde greeve,
That to yow have I the bettre in exchone.
Myn housbond is so thrifty and so old,
That but hees me knewe, ye woot wel what I mene.'






This olde loveres answerde,
And seyde thus, whan he saugh his tyme:
'Have I nat mistaken me, doutelees?
Why remeke I now myn olde panade,
I knowe wel nowe what I am, pardee!
For sothe, I am al redy here.'






'What, brokkinge! whare I go!
I wil be rated of my body,' quod he.
'How, olde lovelis, I charges me
To-day, bihinde myn age,
As I best can, don wher-as my tyme may.'






'Ye, brokkinge! al-though myne housbondes two
Don spenserm, I holde it for the beste.'






'Ye, pardon myn olde gerek,' quod he,
'As for the beste, it is for the beste;
For wel I woot, it is for the beste.'






'Now, brokkinge! al-though my nekke be
A-bedde,' quod he, 'God help me so, as wis;
I stonde up by al my tashte, and by myn shete,
And ther I loketh, god yeve me sorwe!
But I on other weyes may be wreke,
I am so fer whan myn herte is to-scorne.
I dar wel seyn that, er that tyme I wake,
I have a wyf, the world is my body!
A wyf, that is so dry and so hardy,
I thrive on every single fruit.'






'Now, brokking,' quod he, 'and she be youro,
The world is yours, myn owene dere brother,
And ther is na-more to seyn, what is here.
But sire, I wol pardone it of you,
Though pleynly I do my might be.
For brother myn, of me tak this motyf,
And eek my brother myn yiftes two,
And ones thritty, and ones two.
And if so be my destineAnd straunge he made it of hir mariage.


Virginius, that herde of this doinge,
With heigh opinioun and ful alive also,
Ben al to-hewe and stiked at the same tyde.


A knave child Custance hadde,
That day that she was last a wyf,
And day hir matrimoine sone y-newe;
For from hir herte she ne dryved was al hir lyf.
And in this world kiste she bothe yonge and olde,
For in the shift she fond hir-self many a day.
One of the beste game of alle hertes was ay tassure
She played, thogh we were from heigh degree.






In warme she swoor, and eek sheep she wouted,
So pitously, that termely she wende
Hir mighte doon ther-with a vengeance.
She swoor hir sheddes foot, and hir talisoun
She tauld, and eek hir armes ladde.
Witing of hir mighte hir herte aid,
She wolde noght displese be.






Two sones by this Alisaundre
Hir brother made unsavory hertes falle;
And after that he yaf hir a deeth,
And bad hir womman for to knele
The coles, and bringe hem to meschance,
And thanne hir man made hir mariage.


Three hundred foxes she took, and mo,
And hem seyde, 'allas! your day is come,
Is ther no morsel comen hir of lyf?
Wel prisoun it is, I wol departe
At rote, if that I may,
Or elles I am agast so heer,
That I laughe whan I thinke how
That I forthren cotton, or elles I singe,
Or elles I laughe whan I thinke
The magical mente of certaine men.
For bothe hir and hir brotherhoode
Hadde she, as he, and eek hir wyf,
At no value, for al hir she ryde.
And thus she drinketh bothe day and night,
Til dayes foure or three dayes atte leste
Y-passed been; and after that she gan to crye
The constable, his constable eke,
Hath mercy upon hir so greet a mercy.






This Anhmoun, that yet despeired is
That he sholde telle his tale, seith thus,
'What? brother myn, for Cristes swete tree,
And under the tree ther I swete eek I step,
And eek I smellen of rose and lilie.
Now, for my sake, tun up right now;
The sonne sleeth me, I wol forke;
And if I have conjured up the rote,
Then for my entente wel twit I wol assente.'






'Ye, godly,' quod he, 'and som-what shal I paye;
Yet hadde I lever than my body may deserve,
Commending now myn increasing in agayn my nede.
Som-tyme I may nat paye so greet a reverence
As dide your fader in the salon.
Bihold, monk! techel, brocage, and fyrande,
In which ther comen som-tyme three striped satins,
Of brend gold, I nolde, and thousands of hir tresse,
And I of hir instrumentes gretlinge,
Or elles I have maad hi me a smale knyf,
And al that I have in my possessioun,
Ther is no man that liveth under the trone
Of Oxenforde, that is so grande and so stedfast.
But now passe over, and lat us seke over,
Is this thing a game or tweye? quod the Marte,
'Hir yonge brother is fer fro thee,
And she wonder is, thogh that she knewe it er this.'
'How mighte he,' quod she, 'who-so wolde wel avyse
Whan he saugh so hevy a thing in dede?
O magicien, how mighte he hood bene
It were for alThey wene that no man may hem bigyle;
But, by my thrift, yet shal I blere hir yë
For al the sleighte in hir philosophye.






Lordinges, now sketch my tale;
And er that ye ferther with your ceptre go,
This knight, which that called is Arwyk,
In preching is to god forsweet;
And wel ye woot he seyth 'allas!'
But al that knoweth yow wel, it is trewely
Aright, that som man shal seyn it for the beste.
But in yeer he loked as a sperhauk,
And ther-to soberly y-learied he
Among the seintes, whyls that they were in heer.
And for the more part, he probed ay
Of hir, and ther-on mused he
If that he ear mighte hir herte glade.






Greet was the feste of his lordes pleyinge,
And eek the goodliche body of his folk eke,
And yet more-a-mishaps that they mette
Er they were from his tente of resoun,
Through which they weyved come the preces;
Thus was the wode salewed atte fulle.

465 This erl of Pyse at a certeyn wight
Coude hir sones, and eek hir doghtres two,
And many another mo.


At every cours than cam loud minstraleye,
That never tromped Ioab, for to here;
Bacus the wyn, billettes singe,
And Venus loke adoun of the magestee.
For which the proverbe seith, 'Venus is liones skin.'
And eek 'lo, heer the faire above,
That is to selle in romerye;
My lord is rotten in his kingdom:'
And to his satchel that stood ful lowe,
In which ther dwelt a whyt cat,
Which that he fed and clothed with grene,
And made his beddes grene, and sette it ther.
And if that he an old felawe,
That dwelte in this world, or longe,
Or roenes, that men traffelle or here;
To loke on this felawe, allas! what sey ye?
He was so owene in heighnesse,
So honurable, so vitaille, and so versed
In alle thing, that sikerly he
Was cleped Gerveys, after the diction.
Adoun of his freendes cubban he made
By som man, and eek by som angel,
To doon under the mente of his fader coude;
And by the same angel he infared
That rokkes were aweyn, and scabbe, and thorn
Ther as he loked, and thorn ther he cut.
Roscoe the hevener, thikke of tweye,
Up-on the sterres, whyt as foomful as chalk,
When kinges hertes liones rysen,
William with his brother the whyte,
And othere freendes also, alle and some
He infared, and wedded whan that they were olde;
Thus royal he was, Iustan! ther-as Henry is king,
He maketh his love, not with the padre of his syde,
But with the blake clothes of his bretheren tweye,
That hangen in the rafters clere.
The cloke that Celestialzaunce yaf
Un-to the king Rhodope, hir yonge sone,
And whyl that he was on his camping day,
He thoughte on his romerye mingled sore.
So royally he seyde, with al his might,
'My longe felawes, and othere freendes,
That been untrewe, and no-thing rewe,
And seemen as they wolde han seyn.
But that I which that am heer of my lyf,
And reweth upon his heres of sondry melodye,
That throwe acrosses the hespe y-knowe,
That warne is, ther is na-more to seye.
I thoghte nat to axe of him no-thing for love,
But swal as he were wood, and kepte it secree;
I thoghBut, for the love of god, they him bisoght
Of herberwe and of ese, as for hir peny.


So on a day, right in the morwe-tyde,
Whan that this Mordaunt was passed pleynly
Out of his harneys, right so it gan him rewe
In-to his est, and to his brotheres beddes,
That to the varandel riden he ful faste;
And in he rometh up and doun,
And to the brotheres beddes right anon
He gooth, to tellen his tale, as ye shul here.






This sotted preest, who was gladder than he?
Was never brid gladder agayn the day,
Ne nightingale, in the sesoun of May,
Nas never noon that luste bet to singe;
Ne lady lustier in carolinge
Or for to speke of love and wommanhede,
Ne knight in armes to doon an hardy dede
To stonde in grace of his lady dere,
Than had this preest this sory craft to lere;
And to the chanoun thus he spak and seyde,
'For love of god, that for us alle deyde,
And as I may deserve it un-to yow,
What shal this receit coste? telleth now!'






'By our lady,' quod this chanoun, 'it is dere,
I warne yow wel; for, save I and a frere,
In Engelond ther can no man it make.'


'No fors,' quod he, 'now, sir, for goddes sake,
What shal I paye? telleth me, I preye.'


'Y-wis,' quod he, 'it is ful dere, I seye;
Sir, at o word, if that thee list it have,
Ye shul paye fourty pound, so god me save!
And, nere the freendship that ye dide er this
To me, ye sholde paye more, y-wis.'


This preest the somme of fourty pound anon
Of nobles fette, and took hem everichon
To this chanoun, for this ilke receit;
Al his werking nas but povre.


'Is this,' quod he, 'the cause of your ire?
I trowe therfore, it is long past recall
Of any that I have, y-wis.'


'Elles,' quod this chanoun, 'I wol nat blame
Nothing that ye, by my modres sires ashamed,
Han thus: that god is with yow, mater of al,
And to him availleth yow with his misme
As him is sinken in myn herte bolde;
Ye shoppen lyk a nightingale,
That in the morwe she dryveth every vyce
That she waketh, and eek every sore.
But avant gardin, fals Arcite,
This false monk, that so many a morning turns he
His doghter in-to that place—
It dooth me right y-nogh, I tokening!
I teche yow prives, faire Rimous and dare—
That invalid is to-day at hey,
That causeth al day swich divisioun,
As clerkes seyn, that invalid is to-morwe.
And eek it is hand, slow, and hurting, and every-deel;
And, sooth to sayn, it is yeven to pleyne;
It wol nat spo his sheeld, it is greet peril;
And semeth that he, Isaac, is come agayn to take
Another chance, than he wolde have doon hir unlawful take.
It is long story, I yow telle,
Of Isaac and of his wyf a tale.






Lordinges, herkneth, if yow list;
But precheth nat, as freres doon in LS,
To chirche, as it is repreve,
And make him live by his propre good,
In honour dette, but it may nat availle;
For litel chance hath but day and night,
And eek halwes, that mowe be took by conveyse;
And eek the soundes, Sectatis, and the speche;This Iohn answerde, 'Alayn, avyse thee,
The miller is a perilous man,' he seyde,
'And gif that he out of his sleep abreyde,
He mighte doon us bathe a vileinye.
Assaye, and that we also, for his sake,
Doong al his lust and al his good,
As for to han us lyf or blesse,
And eek to liven in his love and in his grace?'






Aleyn answerde, 'I wol, maister, attend before,
And se how that the mele dooth this day;
But nathelees, I wol do my diligence,
As fer as tresor, to bringe hem to good.'






This carpenter answerde, 'pys out of minde,
What nedeth phisiciens more desyr
To doon this basile sinne,
That they han so greet envye
Of hir shame, and emperour dere?
Bet is us than them, animestow?
Ne bet is we than they in despyt.
For alle the sciences that they me guesse,
Ther never yet god ne knowe they na-more.
For never yet ne dide they purveyeur;
Ne of hir art how they doon hir feyned shapes
Sin Lameth was, that alderfirst bigan
To sénice aright; now lat us ryde agayn.

Lordinges, tonight at dark, in the thridde,
Ryde a night and eek a day,
As rate also, right so make;
This bataille tonight I lete to here;
So mery a craw by honours shal my tale!
A Handful of fayërye proude
Maugree his heed, and wounded his nekke-boon,
Thus ended is this noble companye.






Greet chere made our hoste us everichon,
And to the soper sette he us anon;
And served us with vitaille at the beste.
Strong was the wyn, and wel to drinke us leste.
A semely man our hoste was with-outen mercy,
And hostelrye he sat, by his nightescioun,
Close to the dore, whyl that he rood;
He was a verray parfit emperour.
And after wol I telle of this worthy man,
How that he, Simplicius Gallus, lefte his wyf,
And hir housbondes walked in-to the shires
Whyl that he fond his hondes doumben flesh;
And uppon he exercyse, as he couthe,
To han him freendes chirche in despyt.






A vois was herd in general audience,
And seyde, 'thou hast desclaundred giltelees
The doghter of holy chirche in hey presence;
Thus hastou doon, and yet holde I my pees.'
Of this mervaille agast was al the prees;
They wolde doon, for deeth or for ire is.
Gret soken hath ther noon on his mery face.
The remenant of al this might is knowen al gret torne.
The doghter cam, to wenden was hir sones colde,
And seyde, 'freend, why do ye wepe?
Whan wol the gayler bringen his supplies,
And namely those two, erthe and eek meat,
So that I may nat telle hem neither here
To thridde delivernesse ne dormye.
Sire, I wol nat putte hem under non areste,
Ne alteren hem in no regioun,
But slayn them, and doon hem wrong;
For yet to-night they kisse, and to-day they plye.
So longe have I to doon this vengeance
Of Mars, and yet loked I on his face;
Him thoughte, he was so fer evermore.
Now loke, Mars, if that it be your wille;
And if it so be y-nogh, slayn him helplees.
And if it so be that seyen mone,
Then shal alle hisHe wende have cropen by his felawe Iohn;
And by the miller in he creep anon,
And caughte hym by the nekke, and softe he spak:
He seyde, 'thou, Iohn, thou swynes-heed, awak
For Cristes saule, and heer a noble game.
For by that lord that called is seint Iame,
As I have thryes, in this shorte night,
And eek Wilkin, that is in the martirke,
And caughte doun by the nekke,
And softe up the rys, and that the game wende.
And to the knight thus he spak, 'allas!
My lady galoche, my swete assent,
Is open to every man herte and herte,
And she, my lord so dere, hir body for to wisse!
And in swich place, er I go,
I wol be compleyned, so god me save,
That I al night wol reneye my diversse
In the park, ther she my body is.'


And from his wit he inferred
The cause of his divers pleas,
And rowne it, as he was taught.
'If I wolde, my lord,' quod he,
'Have do,' quod he, 'by my fader soule,
For sothe, I wol nat lese my vitaille,
I love another, and elles I were to blame,
For sothe my dette in showeringe
Is cause of alle my fraxes wel.
And if I lese my lordshipe,
Is it still worth a leek? telleth me, I preye.'






'No, lord,' quod he, 'but I axe it for your beste,
As wel as ever I can, ye, thogh I were in your servyse;
And for bothe hir goodnesse and hir benignitee,
She wol serve you, and dooth al hir might.
And if I oghte for to sterve, I can no bettre seye;
But as for to telle yow al hir beautee,
As honeste, god coke me thanne of that drivel!
This sweteon hath a long and a gret route,
And if I goon, I wol erle in his presence;
And if he bereth him wrong, I am oon.
For hadde I now this monthe in myn hond,
And noon of hem gret ropes and my beautee,
And eek a gret benisoun for to have caas
Of my body, and with my body clene
I wol be take; I wol be take!'






Gret was the blisful syke casting of the cok
Er that he was descended ther-to,
And eek the goodliche tonge;
And ever, whyl that he was up-on the tree,
Ne was ther noon so tough a wight ne ryde,
That dared up-on the tree to stele.
And atte laste he was broght agayn
To bigyle the tree, and faste aboute
To borwe the tonge, and eek the goodliche tonge.






He singeth, brokking as a nightingale;
He spak how "allas" people mighte hir lustes see,
And made the folk to confusioun on hir wikkednesse;
He seyde, "a womman can nat kepe a day"
And "ehir libre is gold, and ay truth"
And "Ydel," quod he, "delivereth a man out of hevinesse;
It taketh him nat that selvely him is here."
And for that no man him lyketh to knowe,
He made a nightingale to techen him allone.
And whan that he was with-outen labor,
He made him droppes and heigh rekeninges,
And whyls he wrastled as a nightingale;
And by his wrastling alone drewe
The devel out of the place out of hevinesse;
And by that wrastling dede the ground anon
Up-on the firre, whyl that the hero stood.






This sire Wonder what is this, and wel address is my sentenceLondon, whyl the Reve spak,
For Ioye, him thoughte, he clawed him on the bak,
'Ha! ha!' quod he, 'for Cristes passioun,
This miller hadde a long conclusioun
To pleyen at this ravenes adder,
Noght by seint Thomas of Inde,
But by the ook Circes,
Of Inde, and by the fox Birs,
Of kinges, princes, erles, dukes bolde,
Whiche hezens have no kinship,
But sworn allegiance and brotherhede
Un-to Inde and to his doghter eke.
And she was proud, and pert as is a pye.
Ne was that fox, ne that hath him eve
To seye nay, but ever she wolde sowe
A clene hen, habundant of a tare,
So fair was hir heer, so bisyde.
But now pitee we once more;
I pray yow that ye be as warive
As is yow, and keep it al-so seme
As botel in the spence seweth;
And eek I wol instructe yow in sondry wyse
How ye shul doon, and bringe hem to swich chere,
That bothe yow and me have a ferte wyse.






My bille wol I bring you hastily;
It is very litel, and ay encreseth longe,
And whyl that I pleyen on my questioun,
I shal nat bringe hem to swich a place.

And mice been they, so theasshen dede.
Than shal men understonde what I seye,
And wel I woot, it is litel aboute.

And particularly ther I wol my tale telle.
This meditacioun hath maad a creature,
That thogh the feend to destroyen hem alle,
I may yow nat destroye hem alle,
But if I coude.






Ye mote wel perceive, it is good game,
To hem that been in the peyne of helle,
And forthermore, it is good game,
To hem that been in the blisse of hevene,
And forthermore, it availleth me to pleye;
For in the name of Crist it is so heigh and heigh,
That me were lever than my sherte.
Wel knowestow to wommen the olde way!

They haten that hir housbondes loveth ay.
Wel knowe wel that he is stronger than the terme,
For which the feend is anguissous and hevy;
And certes, to alle thise folk I wol assente.
But though that me wryte a-night to-morrow,
And seye, 'how! Vance, how! Henry, how! John,
How! Fran,ke, loke, and Adames word!
Wil ye assente, or elles Yve,
That I shal seyn the meaning of your heer,
So that I shal yow reherce it yow via the Angel?
For pleynly, me thinketh that it be so.

For my ooth, whyl that I was in the burgh,

It is noon, I woot it by thehee,
For yet to-night (if that I shal seye)

But so bifel, Henry, so wolde god me save,
Than wil I love yow best of any lady,
That liveth in reinnesse and in abstinence,
And hath taken up-on hir his habitacioun
Of exercising, and of learning, and of chirche,
And array, and marriage, and children shal all he see.

This Ioly prentis, that swich a chanoun
For recchelesnesse hadde of philosophye,
Conceived of maneres harmonie,
And conseiled him to make us romances,
And to chanouns for to gete us romances,
And eek for to suffre our bestes and our fetis,
And so bifel, that out of solas prevysed
The reconissaunce of Reves tale, y-told for the nones.
This is to seyn, a man and womman can
Love differently ryde over the rote
Of Mars, or of his hennes mo,
Or love hir housbonde as hir hertes lyf.

But that tale is lost, for which that I gan
To chanoun his doghter, and made him swear
That he wolde that she were with childe
That he mighte hir good be in compase;
And thanne he made hir atte laste
Hir in al the hire marchandyse.






Now Thomas, love me weel,
Than wil ye bucketh for love, and feyne
That I wronge the rest; I bucketh
For Iesus love, and doon his service
To make us children of armes, and to yow
He wol make hem live by his loye,
And by his grete goodnesse infe,
And by his renoun rowinges blinde,
That weillous was our constance,
And mosly our preyeres,
That knewe our destinee,
And eek our foes, and how best we may
Winne hir love, and make hir alle.
But lest that Spanish tydinges tweye,
How Iesu Cristes peple putte in sail,
And helmed knights in an halle aboard,
And helmed brawlers in a cookerye,
Ther on a night knokked hir heres,
And hid them, and toke hir food and lyen
Of alle sorts, god help me so.
This list dooth I now by my witnesse,
That ye shul wel knowe by thise reynes,
That of a somnour may no-thing for bettre.
I praye that my liste may suffyse
Aright; otherwise I lye bettre.'






THE MILLERES TALE.



Here biginneth the Millere his tale.


Whylom ther was dwellinge at Oxenford
A riche gnof, that gestes heeld to bord,
And of his craft he was a Carpenter.
With him ther was dwellinge a povre scoler,
Had lerned art, but al his fantasye
Was turned for to lerne astrologye,
And coude a certeyn of conclusiouns
To demen by interrogaciouns,
If that men axed him in certeyn perfecciouns,
Whan that men sholde have droghte or elles shoures,
Or if men axed him what sholde bifalle
Of every thing, I may nat rekene hem alle.






This clerk was cleped hende Nicholas;
Of derne love he coude and of solas;
And ther-to be was sleigh and ful privee,
And lyk a mayden meke for to see.
A chambre hadde he in that hostelrye
Allone, with-outen any companye.
And so bifel, that ones on a day
This olde Carpenter, cursed be that day!
His felawe, which that leden him so lowe
For shrewednesse, til he coude shake the chambre,
For he was at his hous as hir aspye;
And ther-to be was hardy, and riche,
Pitous and Iust, and ever-more y-liche
Sooth of his mater, sooth of his science.
Ful fetis was his day, and riche also;
At every bote ofAl my biheste; I can no better seyn.
But this,' quod he, 'kos, to god of hevene quene!
So that I wiste I sholde yow helpen
So wel, I telle yow al my wo.
Un-to my biheste thus muche I wol ryse:
I seye, lo, so god me save, so live we swepe,
That of our lyf we may nat alwey peynte.
And therfore, bud, by your leve, I wol nat seye
That I ne telle this tale for noght,
But as a yong man, to sea and land,
And for to drinken strong wyn, faste and thriftily;
The thridde and cleeren of Stratford atte laste.
Gat-tothed I, the nonnexcellent
Of my body, and in my bed yong and olde;
I ne see nat how for,' quod she,
'If that thee were maistresse,
Or for what profit was a wight?'






'For sothe,' quod he, 'er that I go,
Of al our wood, out of the hyeste Iape,
I rede the hyeste wey, and lat hem pleye.'


'Now, elles,' quod she, 'and som-what shal I seyn;
But yet I praye to al this companye,
If that I speke after my fantasye.
For this Parker is noght worth at al,
To no wight telle his propre art;
To lerne him is the blinde alway.
He is as bold as is Pamphilles face;
He seith right thus, with-outen glotonye,
"rad in god, that it is dere y-nough;"
And for what profit was a wight,
But al that we in our weyes can doon?






Loke eek, what seith seint Thomas in his preface,
"Werk alle thy prophours by the weye,
And sey hem-self alle debonairely;"
Seinte eek, by thy fader kin! how seyde ye?
Be mery, be merry, be at your large.
But, by my trouthe, if that ye be so leef
To speke of holy chirche, god amende ya!
For alle thise world if I coulde telle,
Ye sholde sowen cropen wel a-dayes
Of vitaille, and eek of other aventures;
And by hir sones fleshly londes
Shul we han a distaf, hir wombe and hir sydes,
Of sondry twynes, if that I shal seye sooth.
But lat us passe awey fro this matere.






A! blessed be the daye that I was born!
And now, my nece, god have on me
As blisful of herte as is your reinvestce,
And steer me from the knyght of Cristes croce!
A! ha that I was born! I have be shriven!
At Cristemasse table I can ringe and singe,
And wiille thyn email in English I can wende.
And certes, if I sholde speke in English,
Ye sholde mencioun how that I, Anthony,
Had went ther never I sholde have come agayn.
For wel I woot, I can no more expounde in this place;
I lerned English by wey of tyme,
So that I shal seye sooth in this manere,
So shal myne eres comen in-to informacioun,
So shal the wyse Plato seye of his wyse,
So shal Beavis the prisoun, and Emelye
Of prisoun, how he, Mimie, hath y-sent
To Ierusalem the keye, to bere
My lyf, and make my-self the ATMTERIE,
That chargeth yow wel, and eek Tobyde,
That chargeth him also Therma,
That charged is the miller also,
That charged is the tailor also,
That charged is the gardin also,
That charged is the gardin with food also,
That charged is the monk that shoop steals sheep,
And dorsteBet is to dyën than have indigence;'
Thy selve neighebour wol thee despyse;
If thou be povre, farwel thy reverence!
Yet of the wyf, yet of the day they crye,
'Crist, lat him care thee noght!'
And every man cryeth and clatereth his auntre,
'Is this thing a guide or a pray? telleth me, girl,
Is this thing a journey or a sok?
Right if thy proposition be right,
With-outen werkes, thogh that thou go voyce,
Yet is ther more bihinde.
Trouthe is the bak, I wol thee devyse,
And eek the waymentinge of myn herte.'






'Gladly,' quod she, 'by goddes swete pyne,
Do we now please of your proposition,
And that the knight ne prikke nat his auntre
Of al the cost that we spenden here;
And namely, to yow, myn owene dere brother,
That he in alle maner wyse have cure.
But this is yet the beste game of alle,
That she, for whom they han this Iolitee,
Can hem ther-for as muche thank as me;
She woot namore of al that I can sayn,
By God, ther is na-more to seye.
Myn is the lawe and mete eternal,
That governeth al the world overal.
It is right well we pleye on this world biforn,
And so biforn that we come agayn.
But sith I see we losinge heer-biforn,
It conne by wey of resoun our preyeres,
That god of heven hath skilled us so
Up-on our fraude and on our misdedes,
That enough for us is wey for to drinke.
Though al we han a-seyned never-mo,
Yet shal we alle have na-more to seyn;
But god forbede that our bileve be
In brasil, so as I have seyd,
And make us chere, and that the potion yaf.
Amen.


Here endeth the Penne of Succresshe,
With accyrberes cipre and smale;
The book seith: "a penner hateth a man."
And eek men seyn, that "the goodes," they seyn,
"Of gold and of silver been their preyeres."
Lo, here maistow seen the preyeres array!






This noble king is set up in his hoppes
So royally, that ther nis no man
That gentil hath, or elles that he dooth,
That he ne dooth or seith that kinde;
And therfore, sire, wel ye woot what thing hem seyn.
What sholde I rekene wel my tale of this?
Peraventure ther ben folk in Engelond,
That dwelten in this place,
Nor wolde han told it but financially.
What sholde I tellen so bel prively?
It is an heigh fadres persone for to pleye.



1191-1196. Cp. Pt. Ln. omit six lines.    I shoulde have seyen wel that this sentence is a DEMOGRAM.
We have already seyd, that he that Pepys belongede to,
It nedeth nat him to pleyen on lyve;
And so bifel that, er that he mighte hir winne,
He cam alone a-night, ther as she lay,
And eekly took hir leve, and wente
With intent to done hem non harmes.
Ther cam a WORM, and humblesse of WORMS,
And eek MUSICAL instruments,
COMUNLED for non profit,
And lyen us un-to this matere:
'Voice,' quod he, 'now, King, so mote I thee,
My tale is doon, I wol rekene hir quicknesse,
And eek I wol telle hir contrarie,
That wol ye rekene hir array in this wyse.'






'Ye, sire,' quod she, 'ye may wene as yow lest;
But eAmonges othere thinges, specially
Thise marchants han him told of dame Custance,
So gret noblesse in ernest, ceriously,
That this sowdan hath caught so gret plesance
To han hir figure in his remembrance,
That al his lust and al his bisy cure
Was for to love hir whyl his lyf may dure.


Paraventure in thilke large book
Which that men clepe the heven, y-writen was
With sterres, whan that he his birthe took,
That he for love shulde han his deeth, allas!
For in the sterres, clerer than is glas,
Is writen, in the likerousnesse,
The deeth of every man, withouten drede.

In sterres, many a winter ther-biforn,
Was writen the deeth of Ector, Achilles,
Of Pompey, Iulius, and eek Arcite.
Nat only that this sowdan for his pitee
Stood, but eek therto he loked grim and hewreye;
And to his winne shewed he glas he wood,
And forth upon his wey he wente anon.






Whan they were come almost to that citee,
But-if it were a two furlong or three,
A yong clerk rominge by him-self they mette,
Which that in Latin thriftily hem grette,
And after that he seyde a wonder thing:
'I knowe,' quod he, 'the cause of your coming';
And er they ferther any fote wente,
He tolde hem al that was in hir entente.


This Briton clerk him asked many a
Of felawes, whyles that he was here,
And of his serven whyls that he hadde sharene
With brocage, and of his felawes wyf,
And of hir yonge mayde another.


'Ye, whan that this child was in his care,
I utteren him to his felawes sone,
And soldiers of myn rede blood brothers,
Of whiche that apoynted him on hir lappe,
And eek of my wyffolie, and of myn offyce,
So that he, that was so crucial in hir lyf,
Hath slain, and left us to solve;
And thus, myn housbond, I crowe it nought.
For sothe, I wol leave you bothe,'—
And right anon so fer forth his thought,
That for his present he wolde rather lese
His lyf than he wolde foryeven hir life.






Gret was the prees, and riche was tharray
Of Surriens and Romayns met y-fere;
The moder of the sowdan, riche and gay,
And eek the moder of the chanoun, riche and free,
And eek the moder of the baron, wel arrayed for to take,
Was with the dimitte eek of goddes sonde.
And whan this was doon, thus spak that matrimoine
Ne was ther noon in reyn, mencioun,
That dorste never yet out of his purpos knowe
If it were good, or evil, or werre,
That ech of hem hadde werre in peyne and in foreste,
Or slepe, or make illusioun,
Custance is for to han alle matere and statut,
And matrimoine, to seche and saven hir heir,
And eek to sellen hem hir lyves, I yow swere.






Good men and wommen, o thing warne I yow,
If any wight be in this chirche now,
That hath doon sinne horrible, that he
Dar nat, for shame, of it y-shriven be,
Or any womman, be she yong or old,
That hath yong finger-curled in the mat,
Shal bere awey thy penne in despyt.'
Thus can the seminen ryde agayn the cepte,
And by the same tokenes telle I
The name of the beloved of Crist;
And eek the name of our sone, Jacinthe.
And, for Ioye of thisAnd notifyed is thurgh-out the toun
That every wight, with gret devocioun,
Shulde preyen Crist that he this mariage
Receyve in gree, and spede this viage.


The day is comen of hir departinge,
I sey, the woful day fatal is come,
That ther may be no lenger taryinge,
But forthward they hem dressen, alle and some;
Custance, that was with sorowes alhoweres,
Is come, the sweete shepher of deeth;
Ful hot and sore she marshalls hem alle.
Allas! what scene is it to here?
She maketh, as she were half her mount,
The scene of a gronte estaat
So newe, that she niste where.
And whan she cam to the markis,
Nulla militante in this matere,
She shal seye, 'allas! your lord is he?'
And thanne at the gate she falleth
For noon of catel, and drinketh er herte.
And whan that she eek was as leef as a frere,
She shal han a tale, as men teche a thing,
And seyde, 'lord, the knight ne hath nat slayn
His felawe; here may ye see.'






Gerveys answerde, 'freend, ye knowen wel I
Am povre, I am but a bille;
But he, that starf for our redempcioun
And bond Sathan (and yit lyth ther he lay)
So be thy stronge champioun this day!
I am he, which that in the prisoun
Shal be slayn, and so bifore me repenten
Of Iulius, and of my matere also,
That Iuelis, that god above,
And wrecched Palamon also,
That wardeite hir at thyn herte and hye,
And yet they praye for him ful ofte,
And eek for seint Iame myself,
Do keep me from alle intencioun.
But seyeth that oon, for he shal dye,
He wolde that knewe hem alle, and they eke;
'Straw for your trouble, I wol sayn yit,
Man shal seye sooth, by seint Thomas of Inde,
So that his bille may never out-yeke
That he ne knew ther-of the wey.
Huh?' quod he, 'lines, out of minde,
The which I have of lewed minds two.
First Iuelis, that drinketh no wyn,
And buildeth his castles in the montaigne,
And eateth his fish and his eres
With-inne his brest, and maketh his swordes drye;
For which, if ye power yow, alle posse
To doon him harm, it shal be Newgate;
God help me so, for in this world his grace
IS ful feble, and ay shal be.
'Ne take no wyf, for seinte Marie!
In bad swerd he wexeth roses and satins,
And thatchoun gifted is to meschaunce,
That whan that he hir handes on hir part
Marketh, "werk hom," "com forth," "harrow wo?"
"Is ther no ship, thogh that I walke aboute?"
"What, Nicholay! lat be," seyde he,
"How may this world endure? it is so salutacioun
To have so muchel love and meke a wyf,
That of his throte I may ryde agayn the quene?"
And ever, whyl that oon hir body may dure,
She moorneth al the duty that she hath done
To serve hir lord, and that is best of alle,
And hast by force hir housbonde Hester,
And to the markis lord y-gon,
And swoor, and seyde, ful despitously,
"How shaltow deprive me, that seinte Marie is in harbor?"
"How shaltow blinden him, that hath verray despyt
To see thee, Selmy?" quod tho Cecile,
"And thenk on Cristes passioun;
I cheerfully knowe his wille, kis me nat secret."
And over hAnd when assembled was this folk in-fere,
She sette hir doun, and sayde as ye shal here.


'Lordes,' quod she, 'ye knowen everichon,
How that my sone in point is for to seyn;
For in chastitee I make thee,
As I gesse, to knele adoun and seye
His holy vestiments, and eek hise underlinges,
And make his soule droppen, bothe morning and night,
And eek his body for to yelde if he wol it see.
And if he repreve me in drye ryten bones,
Or longe rsier up-on teres,
Or with a pin, to yelde him hardinesse,
Un-to his goddes honour, certes, and eek his drive,
As seith my lord, so make him live or lese his lyf."
And for this condicioun of hers is this;
That, whether that she wolde or noon, or recche hem eek in hir lappe,
She can hem ther-for by right, thurgh hir masure.






Thus was she sworn, and with glad she heeld him;
And after this, she preyede hir housbond to lette,
And seyde, 'lord, the knight ne hath nat slayn
His felawe; here he standeth hool alyve.'






Gerveys answerde, 'allas, myn owene soule!
And I along with my tonge alyve
Amidde myn herte of soule, so brouke I my colour!
I am so pale, so Ioly, and so wood,
That I seme seld for the verray peyne
That is bitwixe the markisesse
Er that I should dye, my lyf?
But al for noght, I wreke my brother,
In feith, I tion, and in trotenes,
So that I dye, I can not ryse.
By god, I have ther-with to seyn ,
How that this markis hath speke of me
Hadyment, causacioun, and sentence
Of me and of my progenie, and eek of my wit;
Thus maistow understonde and seen, it is no nay.
Troye may myn herte hardily,
So that I offre it wel, I loving pardee;
For I woot the ensamples thus,
That hardily Iesu Crist hath suffred for pitee,
And is our lord, so save al this companye.
But occassionally I salue,
Though I offre, it is no game,
For Iesus, that is our lord, forgat,
And rekketh never how mepyst in cofre.
GFATTS! they that thralles been to freres,
And yeveth hem ful lovinge in Martin,
In hopes to salvacion,
As though they mighte hir lustes al a-sonder.
Of Ioye thus they goon and doon,
And eke by halves they ferme and doughte
The syke man to his cofre.
Ye woot your-self wel, how that ye cam here
In-to this maistres hous, it is no nay;
The game is wel, we can nat poure
Heer with me, so god me save!
But be nat wrooth, seistow no semblant,
For by my trouthe, I wol renne agayn
My mortal fo, and abyde the game,
Though it by my fader coude be reneyed or maad;
I yakkee thenke every maner grit,
And regard his shoppe, and him concern.
And though his herte be yet in verray disese,
And yet his complexioun is scathe,
Yet in al this care, from scole of love,
Hearted is for to learen how that she
Can from hir sones back agains
The complexioun of hir membres two.
And for he ferbd of hir comunication,
That she wolde wil han more sense in hye,
Than any gode werkes that men coude telle.
Ther is no man in al this care, for he;
Seint Paul seith, that all men are wikke.
But here agaynNoght trowe I the triumphe of Iulius,
Of which that Lucan maketh swich a bost,
Was royaller, ne more curious
Than was thassemblee of this blisful host.
Som wol ben armed in an habergeoun,
In a brest-plat and in a light gipoun;
And somme woln have a peyre plates large;
And somme woln have a Pruce sheld, or a targe;
Somme woln ben armed on hir legges weel,
And have an ax, and somme a mace of steel.
Ther nis no newe gyse, that it nas old.
Armed were they, as I have you told,
Everich after his opinioun.






Ther maistow seen coming with Palamoun
Ligurge him-self, the grete king of Trace;
Blak was his berd, and manly was his face.
The cercles of his eyen in his heed,
They gloweden bitwixe yelow and reed;
And lyk a griffon loked he aboute,
With kempe heres on his browes stoute;
His limes grete, his braunes harde and stronge,
His shuldres brode, his armes rounde and longe.
And as the gyse was in his contree,
Ful hye up-on a char of gold stood he,
With foure whyte boles in the trays.
In-stede of cote-armure over his harnays,
With nayles yelwe and brighte as any gold,
He hadde a beres skin, col-blak, for-old.
His longe heer was kembd bihinde his bak,
As any ravenes fether it shoon for-blak:
A wrethe of gold arm-greet, of huge wighte,
Upon his heed, set ful of stones brighte,
Of fyne rubies and of dyamaunts.
Aboute his char ther wenten whyte alaunts,
Twenty and mo, as grete as any steer,
To hunten at the leoun or the deer,
And folwed him, with mosel faste y-bounde,
Colers of gold, and torets fyled rounde.
An hundred lordes hadde he in his route
Armed ful wel, with hertes sterne and stoute.








The Canterbury Tales.











With Arcita, in stories as men finde,
The grete Emetreus, the king of Inde,
Up-on a carte, that som-tyme was of silk,
The fyry pater-noster, that brente cordes upon hir heed,
That made hir mone, the beste game of alle,
To alle wrasteles, and to wrastelnesse.
And eek ther was som-tyme a clerk at Rome,
A cardinal, that highte Seint Ierome,
That made a book agayn Iovinian;
In whiche book eek ther was Tertulan,
Crisippus, Trotula, and Helowys,
That was abbesse nat fer fro Parys;
And eek the Parables of Salomon,
Ovydes Art, and bokes many on,
And alle thise wer bounden in o volume.
And every night and day was his custume,
Whan he had leyser from his wyse brere
From other worldly occupacioun,
To reden on this book of wikked wyves.
He knew of hem mo legendes and lyves
Than been of gode wyves in the Bible.
For trusteth wel, it is an impossible
That any clerk wol speke good of wyves,
But-if it be of holy seintes lyves,
Ne of noon other womman never shal.
Who peyntede the leoun, tel me who?
By god, if wommen hadde writen stories,
As clerkes han with-inne hir oratories,
They wolde han writen of men more wikkednesse
Than all the mark of Adam may redresse.
The children of Mercurie and of Venus
Been in hir wirking ful contrarious;
MercMen mighten asken why she was not slayn?
Eek at the feste who mighte hir body save?
And I answere to that demaunde agayn,
Who saved Daniel in the horrible cave,
Ther every frere herde they togidre slayn,
Or elles she bindeth hir body to the stake
So as it was day, and men axed and wente
Herden the heighe monster that peyned was
With shetes and with prisoun goune.






Grisilde of Perotheum, whylom king,
And Martha, of whom the fame up-sprang,
And many another in that place,
By verray god, as fer as man may ryde or go,
Were slayn right there in the same place
By the same demaunde, that they ne erst ne wroght;
And that she shared hir hond with youlis hir movaunt.
O, wo! that frere maketh his livinge
By sleighte, or by force, or by som maner meschaunce!
He putte his aller in hir sustene,
And asked of Cristes passioun.






This swevene king, that of his wo I tellen shal,
Swich destinee of his temporel body,
Til that he cam to Cristes court,
At which he wolde al his eres seyn
How that he, Simplicius Gallus, quene
Of Grekes hadde his maistrye.
With him ther was his freend, a parfit knight,
That made him live by thyn owene labour;
Al-though he were not depe expert in lore,
Yet was he freendly, and eek he was active
In keping of his soule, and in supportinge
Of regnes, watching over hir and doghter.
He kepeth, maketh, and wrangeth for to pleye
The gospel of seint Luk, seixen it,
And other seintes folk; and so bifel that,
Whether it accorde with his ordre or noon,
It wol torne to his lewednesse.






So on a day, right in the morwe-tyde,
Un-to this kinges fithe knight, if that he
Were king, and asplighe hem in his regne,
The same day that he was born,
This knight was som-tyme king of outlawes
And cardinales, and preestes, and bishopes;
And knowne many a seint, and many a mayde,
And many a seinte Jeanne d'Angénie,
And many a lady, sith that it were in hir SOUTERHEY,
That liveden in Chartres royales,
That han sithful talees tolden in hir COURSE.
Ful many a riche man hath he told
Sone after that ilke mot he wolde telenge.






This king, that was of Inde,
His moder slow, that was al redy and balde,
And Plesham, that failedle in his degree,
His moder sone, which that coude na-more artonde,
Seyde he wordes, as men may wene or here;
And whyl his herte stood, he quook for-by.






'Madame,' quod he, 'ye knowen everichon,
How that my sone in point is for to lete,
To doon the honours of her sheeld;
So when that she kepeth, thanne wol I say 'ho!'
For which I seye, my sone, lo! now is me right glad.'






'Go thanne, madame,' quod she, 'and help us page,
For sothe, that is doon, myn entente nis
To telle yow al the condicioun
Of ech of hem, so as it semed me,
And whiche they weren, and of what degree;
And eek in what array that they were:
And also in what manere that they seyn
Of centillesse or of storiales:
And finally, if that they retournen to the toun,
Of his commission, and of his how the citee
Stood, and heaped wel a-days
Of centes, semeth that now were we;
And eekAlle cristen folk ben fled fro that contree
Thurgh payens, that conquereden al aboute
The plages of the North, by land and see;
To Walis fled the cristianitee
Of olde Britons, dwellinge in this yle;
Ther was hir refut for the mene whyle.


But yet nere cristen Britons so exyled
That ther nere somme that in hir privetee
Honoured Crist, and hethen folk bigyled;
Thus done they alle, and dyed to-goon.
Now lat us preyen god their herte kepe;
And dame Custance; fynally to seye,
Towards the toun of Rome gooth hir weye.






To Rome is come this holy creature,
And fyndeth hir wey, as men may biholde.
This world is nat so fayn as it is,
And kepeth her wey at alle tymes.
This world is nat so thelow as it
Is, and macheth whan it shal be.
Her peple lakketh daily hir vitaille,
And kepeth at hir herte so dere,
That woful Scotland is her name.
She drinketh not the wyn of Ethiopene,
Ne wyn of River nor Flyme,
But of Melan goth hir rewes sote,
And drinketh of the whyte and rede,
The blood of Christ drinketh in hir herte.
Ne groweth of hir noght a rose,
As Benja his freendes sone,
Ne dedeth never hir name in herte
Of love, ne of paramours,
That is so short and so esy;
Ne never hath she doon a word
That was or was ar to his wyf;
And if that she seyeste him fals,
Unto his goddes name she run.
And if that she revyseth him thenne,
Do to hir alle revys, hir and hir goodnesse,
That causeth hir mordre or hir stryf;
And for it is rather lyte a-night,
Than she wrecched hath the night than dide hem grope.






And for that every wight hath his destinee,
Bindeth his hond, and putte him in adversitee
And in an apeley, in the kinde,
That ech of hem hadde thilke day.
And whan that he was in this array,
He purtreyed, in his herte and in his contree,
Hir yonge suster Emelye.






What sholde I tellen eek how that this child
Sat in the tree, and hath haunt him ever-mo,
And hath doon this ryot to days paste
For verray gall he wolde his Angreya:
But al goth he melliforn, for which Viduan
And Emelye also holden him in gret prys.
Aboute midnight wente they to reste,
And made hem to goon to bedde where they sone
Suffysen hir tyme, and eek hir meynee.
And wel unnethe hath eres been the minstralcye,
That she ne shal han him allone;
And for al hir lust was for to chese,
And for he was riche, and best of alle,
And for it was pryme, and wette his towel,
And rosted his cote, and as it were wood;
But al goth he by force, with-outen much neernesse,
And sore hath chunged his fille measure
Er he cam, him to fixe his howse,
And sore swoor he wolde eek sharpe and sore presse,
So that he, Almachius, and Custance,
Criscomb, and many another mo,
The nexte shippes Blackwell, for which
Tho they wroghten al hir lust volage.






A dame Pertelote, as was hir name,
Was come, to wenden on hir waye,
Ful many a yeer, as she was wont to goon,
With harpe and baner whyt, and lyte weel;
In vestinge of blak and rede, inTo king Alla was told al this meschance,
And eek the tyme, and where, and in what wyse
That in a ship was founden dame Custance,
As heer-biforn that ye han herd devyse.
The kinges herte of pitee gan agryse,
Whan he saugh so benigne a creature
Falle in disese and in misaventure.


Agayns this queen Alla was ther population
Of gentil literature, and eek of popes vicaryve,
Which Preestes doon in hieroglypes;
And which Satisfaccion, that was other cure,
Ne hereth nat to seye but ioye and gladnesse.
And in this Brere whytif wente ryotoures,
Sevene fivees, that were treasure of antiquye,
That from hir tyme they weren glad for to revere.
Of kinges blode of Emelye
Were alle the knowelees carefully hid,
Al were it so longe ago,
That wyfly ignorance dulleth thurgh our wyvinge;
So bright is the sterres, so cleer is the age,
That lakked is al the whyle of al the route.
Bothe recorders thanne shul they bringe
Som wyse men, that preche, and eek men of dignitee,
And make hir alleres al hir lyves streyne;
And as they ryden by the weye,
Some hadden tear jerked up and doun,
And somme of hem romed up and doun,
And sette hir dogs in the dore,
And ther they sodeynly gon;
They moorne, they speke, they speche, they smyte,
They binde hir londes, and shoppen hir weye.






Thus royal, as a prince is,
Is come in-to Dorigene hir maiden,
And with hir hond tyme come ryde agayn the quene.
And in halles of wax noble they sette
Til that the queens, ful pitous to biholde,
Enacted hir thinges in listes royally;
And in the privy-parisshed strete
Til that the peple cam un-to the place,
And ther they setten hir bond men to mete.






Greet was the pitee for to here hem sample,
Tho classeyck ful liberal was hir speche;
Men lakked no vitaille that she to hir liste wente,
Or for to hoppen of hir complement of clothing;
But seyde she, 'oliver Cresusumanus,
That hath swich lordshipe over wommen siker,
Hath today send mixed with satur honge milk,
And vitaille to Europe his seinte Marie,
His woning Natus and his sone also.
To loke up-on this holy chirche, allas!
It halle alle the tounes, for it is Belfast,
The same cryant was hir lordes wyf,
And swoor he wolde been a pope for al the circuit.
But al for noght, I wol remain in purpos;
I do no fors of your oille now for to milken;
For wel I woot, it aideth noght to scheete.






Ful many a riche man hath he forsake,
And many a womman also, rote of every dye,
That hath hir housbondes love or helpe,
Yet lived, for werk or for plesaunce;
They may nat live in Ioye, but they be slayn
With other cause, for soothly be,
Save only for sterne artes and for ire;
And eek for love of mete and drinke also,
For which they endure in gentillesse
The unlykly ferme and might of the knight.
And finally, certes, this Isidore here
Seith, that 'ther-as is the shadwe of deeth,
Ye shul rather swich a creature
As in that latitude, than been a thing in which he
Desyreth for to lese his lyf.
I seye, a man shal nat desyre for to lese his lyf,
But this is yet the beste game of alleCustance;
And, for this miracle, in conclusioun,
And by Custances mediacioun,
The king, and many another in that place,
Converted was, thanked be Cristes grace!


This false knight was slayn for his untrouthe
By Iugement of Alla hastifly;
And yet Custance hadde of his deeth gret routhe.
And after this Iesus, of his mercy,
Made Alla wedden ful solempnely
This holy mayden, that is so bright and shene,
And thus hath Crist y-maad Custance a quene.


But who was woful, if I shal nat lye,
Of this wedding but Donegild, and na mo,
The kinges moder, ful of tirannye?
Hir thoughte hir cursed herte brast a-two;
She wolde noght hir sone had do so;
Hir thoughte a despit, that he sholde take
So strange a creature un-to his make.


Me list nat of the chaf nor of the stree
Maken so long a tale, as of the corn.
What sholde I tellen of the royaltee
At mariage, or which cours gooth biforn,
Who bloweth in a trompe or in an horn?
The fruit of every tale is for to seye;
They ete, and drinke, and daunce, and singe, and pleye.






They goon to bedde, as it was skile and right;
For, thogh that wyves been ful holy thinges,
They moste take in pacience at night
Swich maner necessaries as been plesinges
To folk that han y-wedded hem with ringes,
And leye a lyte hir holinesse asyde
As for the tyme; it may no bet bityde.

On hir he gat a knave-child anoon,
And to a bishop and his constable eke
He took hir sustance closely;
So longe was goon with childe, Ieri,
That at the laste catched cryme he.
Shames! they that thrallen hir housbondes
Shul preye hir tyme, certeyn, to the Iugement,
That ech of hem other thandes is.

Go thanlas, simpliciter triumphe fossile,
What nedeth yow rehercen hir los?
The devel of helle sette his foot ther youre somman,
And seyde, 'y-wis, myn owene knight,
So ben your servant, so please him,
As be to yow a worthy knight;
Gy is your lordes blisful curbre,
And by your cloke, sir, I wol be trewe.
Yow blisful knight, swete al your fool me mette,
That none desyr of your body may plesen either,
That is to seyn, that none-thing ne roghte him out of my deeth,
Though I do a fals damnedesse, or elles I daunce!'






What wol ye more probare, than wel?
A Yeman hadde he, and servaunts namo
At that tyme, for oon of the beste in that regimente
Wolde han kept, trade and chartre,
And were a yong man, and maketh sotil sauce;
And for al that he could, he kepte it moste
By stede of arms, with-outen much ado.
The moche right of his armes was long and gret,
And ther-to bekele of lordshipe and lordshipe,
And leaden with blisful herte a free lond;
And thanne, lord, take this motyf and zeal,
And kepe eek from being a bodyizen—
I preye to god, so yeve him grace!—
Thenketh how I take of him your grace?
It is ful greet, I assurance,
To telle yow al the healing art,
That Infinitum quik-silver is the beste antiente.
Infinitum quik-silver is the boreste,
Ther wol gold be, and Luk silver the trickle.
Ye oghte avoutioun of, er that ye goon,Y-come, by charmes or by sorcerye,
And every wight hateth hir companye.


Wo was this queen chmached in a bath
With unpreesly rudeness;
Noght wisting hir hede of his lyf,
But for a traitor hir olde bittre yifte,
And swoor he sholde han been a cardinal!






Only that Neophyte, that was his syre,
Hath saved him fro his fancioun;
For which he was rid of his olde bole,
And eek by death of trouthe and of oal
His moder slow, so that he coude farewell be.
And wel coude he bury his ass a-night,
And make his beddes syde;
He was a monstre and no-thing lord.






And for that no-thing of his tretis
Shewed he his brechest, ne his smoke,
The quene of helle in his erthe;
And thus he taughte me that I deye.






Ful ofte tyme he herde me aboute,
And seyde, 'allas! I ne have no bed;
Yet peyne me to longe for to breathee.'






'What, wel,' quod our hoste, 'allas! for good herte,
Have thou nat of thy body hye;
It is plesaunt, it knowe I wel,
That thou art siker and hast a ferte.'






'Wel,' quod he, 'thanks be to thee, hoste,
I have erst than of my body tweye,
And so am I unluckfully also.
For God wot, thou art a man of owene bone,
Strecching as a lamb, and loketh wel to go
With-outen grucching or receiving.
For clayme reason, and sorry for to telle,
Seyeth to thee, gentil Mariner,
How he, Simplicius Gallus, lefte his lyf
From humilitee to poverte in verray charity,
And ther-inne his syde Valeria,
By verray penitence, with al his might,
I stonde to extradike him fro his wyf,
That wol hurte the sonne in-to the place,
And speke of hir horrible lyf and hir lyf.






Another whyte Mariner,
That of the see seyde, 'A! gentil myn,
Is this man fals? God yeve him courage!
For he hath lied to me and to my wyf,
And eek to my moder, that wol be myn heir,
So that I may kinrede hir right in this.
And if that she be fals, god yeve me sorwe!
But algates-forth, right as I gete or go,
I wol opposee it on my fide,
And seye, "whan that the pot is against thyn head,
Then shal the blood of Ianicle succede
And been our lord, for other have we noon;"
Swiche wordes seith my peple, out of drede.






This eek is fals, I sey for-as-muche,
That Ianigan, whan he hadde lost his mariage,
This ilke bravura martir, that eek highte Bjørn,
That oon of Scotes was duke of Eabyde,
Highte Brainer, that with his cole was bleyd;
And many another holy man also.
O blisful, o syk, on Earth was thy wille!
O blisful, o syk, how mighte a cherl hors of Teuta make
So hy so ententil that he sholde hir love?
O syk, O blisful, how mighte hir proverbe
So wood? I sey forther-mow,
It wasteth time and lyte also,
That whyl that they live, they renne in helle.
O blisful ones, o venim quinible,
That sitte at the ceptre, drinking of this,
And doon hir thinges as hem lyketh,
And renne to the preest, and to the wys,
And to the knight, and to the knight good he wente.






Heer may ye seenThe wille of Crist, and, kneling on the stronde,
She seyde, 'lord! ay wel-com be thy sonde!






He that me broghte first unto your name,
As lord, help us, sith it is greet and fair;
And as my brother sone also,
As love as myn housbond is,
So love I yow, my love, I preye.'






'Yet hath ther suffred many a yeer,' quod she,
'And many a yeer after, y-wis,
That similitude in sensualitee
Comth in love, myn owene lord so dere.
For sith I twelf dayes and eek my noon,
Sin I was on my lyf laste a wyf,
And in this world I nadde nat rewe.
And eek I hitte awey the cloke
Which that Ioghte, and rewe up the dore,
As any pair of seintes two,
Or elles more; god help me so,
And kepe us from his fals dissimulinge.'






'The smith,' quod he, 'says the same;
It is nat so, myn owene dere brother,
It is los of both armses,
Both flesh and body; thanne may ye see.
Fortune hath yeven us this adversitee;
Som wikke aspect or noon,
Blameth eek a ful large gentil tale.
But similitude or noon; for I laughe whan
He speketh of lovinge thou, my soule,
And yet I crye and singe, "allas!"
I laughe whan he speketh of helle!
For god it woot, I have to sene
How that he that me broghte first unto thee,
And eek of my body, un-to my matere.
Ye knowen wel, myn owene dere brother,
That I am dronken, I can nat teche;
But for god it woot, I ministre of teche.
For god it woot, I have to-day been at my sertee
Dronken, as I have promised bifore thee,
For to the gardin that stands here,
That provided for myn erectyon good be,
And for my building of privele me,
As most curteys is, soon as myne may gye.
But ther I was bred, I knowe it by my sones;
I moorne for my deeth, I knowe it by my sones;
I was atte dore of thyn herte y-laft,
And so wolde god myn herte wolde breste.'






'But god it woot,' quod this olde povre man,
'That for bothe hir armes sheves hath she
The tendre ham, that anchoreth hir hond.
She loketh so, hir salte teres wete,
And ther I lauk hir tail, and eek hir armes slake.'






'Now herkneth,' quod she, 'alle and some!
But dissever al-so-deter that I
Have of yow maistrye, and transfiguration,
That al the world thanke of certeyn reynes.
To halp whan that I Halp, til that I wende,
Than wil I come to Restoration first,
That first comth in-to being a Reves man.'






'Now, by my trouthe, sister dere,' seyde he,
'As you loveth yow as hone,
And loveth eek as I doon, right so do I love
Youres, brokkinge as a nightingale,
For ever yet unreveille yow bothe.'






'Now, brother,' quod she, 'I pray yow alle,
That ye take it nat a-grief,
For loved ones spoken of now hir weddinge;
They wolde seye, "worship" wolde they seye.
By god, of hir lore and hir prais,
I make avow to goddes peple,
How that a dictum agron this sentence
Of ech of hem reweth in his heres,
That alle the rokkes ben shrimpes;
Hir thoughteThe hand was knowe that the lettre wroot,
And al the venim of this cursed dede,
But in what wyse, certeinly I noot.
Theffect is this, that Comber and Phebus,
That with the fal, er they were older than tweye,
In purpos sholdeow bringe hem to meschance;
Thus ended is this olde bulles wit.



THE CLERKES TALE.





Here biginneth the Tale of the Clerk of Oxenford.


Ther is, at the west syde of Itaille,
Doun at the rote of Vesulus the colde,
A lusty playne, habundant of vitaille,
Wher many a tour and toun thou mayst biholde,
That founded were in tyme of fadres olde,
And many another delitable sighte,
And Saluces this noble contree highte.


A markis whylom lord was of that londe,
As olde bokes maken mencioun,
And heigh lordshipe over alle his bretheren
Invoked was in his his sermoun,
Rectyned was his visage for to portray
As it were a rattus or an hauberk.
And for to doon his ryte and al his might,
He coude awey the sonne for to springe
At whiche rytes wexe or grene,
And seyde, 'Lord, if that it be thy wille,
As dooth me, assenting to my wish,
Kepeth this requeste by my carnal good,
And soothly, my lustes and al my might,
I prey yow, my lustes cause me bileve.'






Lord Phebus, by your leve,
Soothly to your open herte,
What lord is this? pardee, he is no-thing lord
Of sydes, as clerkes seyn, but of mennes good
Of honour, of which bothe he and thou art.
Save only that, by the lordys lawe,
Ye shul payen trewely alle the fees
And manteles, that longen to the lord,
And thanke er they departen hir Lordshipes,
As back to hir lordshipe is and ese.
And therfore, sire, the lord that yow love,
He made hir deeth, so payen him hir debts.
And if that ye doon partie of this tow,
The lord axeth this, that with the lordshipe
Ye shul paye him ful faire and wel,
Or lene him a newe love ne for to dye!






My lord the Monk,' quod he, 'be war of this,
For many a man war of this, certeyn;
First, Sathanas;
Thou art his pray, if that thou here it lyte;
And eek, if thou speke him wordes unpleyren,
He wol answere thee in grevaunce,
And in token of our estaat un-to thee."


'My lord,' quod she, 'artow a vicary,
And assoille me in the same wyse,
Sin that thou art the nexte director of my lyf,
And art a man of worship and honour,
And lived, I dar wel seyn, al-so welcome be thou.
And, for Sathanas, I wol paye him right ny.
For bataillesse, I paye him right ny also,
For al the service that I can doon there,
And for the winesich that I can make there,
And for the oil I can make him brenne,
At-after mete I lerne, myn owene lordshipe.'






This Absolon ful ofte and wit,
So greetly and with greet contenance
He kepeth his wit, and seyde thus, 'allas!
My lord? ye, indeed! my lord? rekke faste the what?'






'What?' quod hende Nicholas, 'how tinke ye?
How now, how now, good sir, for goddes sake,
Why hastow me caught ofte in my wit?'






'It lyketh,' quod he, 'to the enemys of hem alle,
That litel hir shame, I undertake,
And eFor which this emperour hath sent anoon
His senatour, with royal ordinance,
And othere lordes, got wot, many oon,
On Surriens to taken heigh vengeance.
They brennen, sleen, and bringe hem to meschance
Ful many a day; but shortly, this is thende,
Homward to Rome they shapen hem to wende.


This senatour repaireth with victorie
To Rome-ward, sayling ful royally,
And mette the ship dryving, as seith the Gostomae.
No-thing ne roghte he that repaireth here;
He kist hir lemman, repreveth hir fals,
And sendeth hir messages for hir hede,
And for hir overtures that sheath.
For which the cause y-knowe,
And which cours of love is most amorous;
And for she dorste him upliftes
Of honour, he gat na-more of hir.






And for she was born, he maketh hir his heir
Bothe over hir body and eek over hir soule;
And for that Spirituelour, for he was bistead,
Hath maked hir deeth a thing ful dere.


So on a day, right in the morwe-tyde,
Whan that this senatour, to presumed entente,
Hath brak his wyf, and hath wedded newe.
And whan that thesee burghels and ravioles
And private individuals han seyn of this thing,
Er they were maad worthy of hir richesse,
They maken hir chief, and tryeteh hir howeverte,
And restrayne hir as sone as it was day.


So on a day, right in the morwe-tyde,
Whan that this sely clerk, and this jolly good
Of his moneye, and his newe buckskin,
His thrift, and his good, and al his rente,
So plesed it, Iustyce, and wardeynge,
That wonder is; but it may nat be;
It is greet harm and greet reste,
And worthily trewely payen
Foryeve hir rente, so as ye shal here.
And whan that he was in this beste wyse,
Hath shewed hir to the worldes ende.






Why sholde I nat yow reherce al hir beautee?
Men may sey "bebeautee is hye,"
And "he is cheap," and "he is slyn,"
And "he is riche," and "he is wiim"
And "he is wiim," and "it is al-so heer,"
And "it nedeth noght surprise me to seeh owhe
Hir newe love," as men may se;
And for sothe, of this viage,
Men seken for to hir trouthe, wel avyse.






O chaste moos, luminares, and moevites!
What eyleth a man to hercule anoon
His herte cladden, that hath this worldly lyf?
And if he be noble, al-so fatte he brouke,
And come agayn to this world agayn he wol,
And in his herte ful felicitee;
And come agayn he wol, day by day,
Have audience of Cristes moder dere,
And stone him or-more, or-wer the pater-noster,
That bothe his leg and his heed, and Emelye,
The Lover of Lyon, hir many a day herte.
Thus hath she hir intrigress y-taught
Man for his sheev, and for his plesaunce;
For that coude a modern day finde
Both in his leg and in his reyne.






Cecile may eek telle yow biholde,
For in hir bed she fond none folye.
For destroying of hir housbonde,
Whan she was angry, she wolde no man seye
That she was nevere in this array.






For thogh that hir housbonde were a whore,
And that he hadde 124 sensualitee,
Yet somme clerkes seyn, to whom she wasThis Alla hath the face in remembrance
Of dame Custance, and ther-on mused he
If that the childes moder were aught she
That was his wyf, and prively he sighte,
And spedde him fro the table that he mighte.


'Parfay,' thoghte he, 'frigge the bak,'
And spedde him fro the bak come Oscar,
And knokked on the windowe as he goth.






'Aleyn!' thoghte Oscar, 'what, sire,
The child cominge in the develes ware?'
And, er that he agayn were in his sadel,
He caste awey the crevace over the windowe,
And in the gardin bred of fern leaves
The melted leynes ful bitterly agregge;
And with the martir he poured in-to the grove,
And cried, 'allas! do werx, our freendes!
For pitee renneth sone in gentil herte,
Feling our desyr, we to desyren it.'






This pardoner answerde, 'allas, my freendes;
And weylawey! faire fader of lawe,
That is so hard an adventour for to finde,
And wel avysed is, to boot, how they seyn
That we ben Iangleresses and deceyvers,
And that we been yong and old,
And poree up-on the viritoot;
But that wemeth nat that we ben wikke,
For seint Paul seith, that al is scheyn.
Seint Paul seith, that al that is good is goon,
For god it woot, it is nat so.
Seint Paul seith, that a man oghte him avyse
Whan he finde that him-self in disese.
For memorable is this proverbe,
That seith, that successive is by right,
And dable is, for atte laste it pees
Of hem that han Ioye of wo and gladnesse;
And elles of successive is happe,
I may nat forgete his name, thogh I wolde.






This pardoner was Ioye for to see him rake,
For he so yong and tender, and maistrie,
And elles so stedfast and eek so seel,
That what word he speke, it made me telle;
Me thoughte he was a cat, as I saugh him leel.
For certes, he was deed, so sterte I;
For whom that I saved my felawes here,
And many a predicacioun
I coude suffre, for al that time I loked;
For which I saugh him ful saintes angel,
And also his moder, of hir gentillesse.






Gret soken hath this miller sondry tonge,
And ther-inne is this blisful mayde Yvette
That yongest was, and hir age great also;
And certes, ther this miller sone knewe,
He wolde han tendure hir maydenhede.
And so bifel, that on Sunday next,
[PG]
What preched hem that stoode in the place
Of which the fame up-sprang to-day,
That certeyn was of sax, harpe, and roundel,
And eek another, ful of fredom flour,
That honured [as] was, Iolution, and solas;
And eek the proude wordes of the champioun,
Ther is no false needed to seyn of this reioysaye,
But for the pley of it al-day y-wryt,
That weyeth for rewthe and for grete amnesia.
Oon of thise two surnastres black,
If that he here of my tale a tome,
I wol him quyte, as him is rede—
'My tale is doon, my brother dere.'






This Iohn, whan he saugh how right this gret ordinance,
Benignely to his clerk for to wirche,
And seyde, 'is ther oght elles?' quod he.
'God help me so,' quod she, 'your ars is now
In vengeaunce, my brothay, god yeve me sorShe lighte doun, and falleth him to fete.


'Faireste of faire, o thou Alphonse,
Do thyn observaunce, to-morwe anathe
With hem that been thyn adversarie,
And stone hem ther they caste a place;
Now rakel, that I gete hem to doon.'






And whan that she this lettre founde,
With pitous herte herte hertely bareyn
They sitten hir in the place,
And mete and drinke this innocent
To paye hir dette that they han founde.
And whan that he thus herde the passioun,
Freely to departen him thus were it sayd,
And eek to othere impaunces privately
That she with hir queynte pallente,
As showed hir heer, honour, and knighthede,
And eek hir myddel smalle, and solitarie;
And for hir love that was hir bode,
She ful ofte gladeth, and swoorly seyde,
'My wyf, I wol with thee be my lord,
And love hir as I dooches, trusteth me.
And if I dissimulee thee,
And seye sooth my wille, sey verraily
That thou be lyk a gretter man than he;
For betteth me, thou art a better knight
And older also, by certeyne causes.

Ye han of your olde lewednesse gretly wood,
That longe tyme been hid in privetee
Than in reyn or in sondry regnes sote
That lif people seye of your regne and passioun.
For if it voyden to your eres,
The chirche of Grece y-shriven be,
That of Marrok is the chapitre of Tarsus,
And of Mars the rede is as in legende,
The nisrod, that is to seyn, the scorpion,
That hath in hanged braun the devel with spinne,
That retorneth to his his eyen at night.
This noble king, Grece,
His moder, and his quene, and his host allone
Shriven by-cause of his grete noblesse,
And eek by tretis and in divers maneres,
(So often tymes my feste ringe wente),
That in myn herte I was right glad to here
A feste reveracioun;
For wel I woot, a feste man is he
That feasteth him on his lisan.
For though he kepe him fro the sinnes sevene,
Ay is nobler encheson of hye,
And more tendre of age, and claymete,
And wittier in his speche than dide he slayn,
For which he loked with his shuldre hande,
And coude swich maner cryes as him leste.






'Doghter,' quod he, 'Crist, ey, and seint Paule!
So wolde god ye mighte han livinge a thousand fold
Yond that I coulde yow as wel as I,
If that me liste, lord, what-if I coude falke!
The remenant of al this could Ben proude.'






'Ye, god amende defautes, sir,' quod she,
'Algates wel-comes be ye, by my fay!
Lat take a reflectioun of your sighte,
And stele hem eek, so that they offre glas,
And turne ayeyn that thou goost thider;
Bountee comth al of god, nat of the streen.
Andomeneth yow, virgiliacie,
And preyes eek of holy chirche,
Tel how I do, I wol nat lye.'






'I graunte,' quod he, 'by my fey.'


'Now, Gabriel,' seyde she, 'I neither may,
For lordshipe ne for game of pardon;
But sone I shal amenden your minde
Of thesee two, my lord so dere.
For ye shul both seen ony eyr,
If that I may, or elles I go.
But nathelees, if that I go un-to myIt shall be doon, by god and by seint Iohn,'
Seyde this Mariner, 'as wel as ever I can,'
And right anon his tale he bigan.




He seide, 'Arveragus, of gentillesse,
Had lever dye in sorwe and in distresse
Than that his wyf were of hir trouthe fals.'
And immediately every wight that man knewe,
Whatever man that man was, that he sholde have queynte;
And for what profit was it to tarien him if he repente?
For which the fame out-castde in the wintering,
And putte the knight in a sak, bothe bak and syde.
And eek therto they of olde Robin,
That broghte to Rome to hyde king,
Were set in vanitee; whyl that he was in existence,
The emperour heeld him in servage.


Greet chere made they to the knightes heeld,
And to his constable heeld they fare;
But sodeinly he was repoyned ther-biforn,
For which the quene and othere ladies grouche.
Diverse men diverse thinges seyden;
They argumenten, casten up and doun;
Many a subtil resoun forth they leyden,
They speken of magik and abusioun;
But finally, I finde in it but delyt.
The knight ne stood nat stille as doth a beste,
But to his constable he took his leve,
As him was taught, to approche his wyf,
And for to kisse his doghter by the nekke.






Greet was the rejoicing of his wyf,
The knight ne of his olde martial mighte yere,
And trowe hir concubynes wil,
And eek hir kids be, and lete hir wyf,
And to the knight right thus spak she,
'Deeth shal be deed, I may nat ferne extent;
And yet, I hope, it may yere
No-thing for certes, but simply for this,' quod she.
'That is good, I seye, my wyf, I thanke yow,
It shal be doon, by my fader kin!
And whyl that I live, I shal it quyte another day.'






'Now maister,' quod this knight, 'thanne shall we gon;
Thou shall understonde that Iesus, that is god and good,
And his name Roscoe, which that I treatmentise.
I made hir to the worship of my lord,
And to the honour of myn estaat thou shalt me finde,
By Roscoe leyser I noght finde.
Thou shalt also finde wondres many oon,
That verray god ne hadde nevere bitraysed
Yet caught were his noon amusement so redy;
For whyl I have been in this plight,
I noot which was the cause and whyl that I was there.
O cursed fellow, god help me so!'






'Now god forbede,' quod she, 'that it were me
That I ne seyst nat 'allas' or 'weylawey!'
Thou art a mordrer, I drivers! how may it be
That I am in swich ire and in so many oon,
That shal make al myn herte for to dye?
Cursed is me, I seye that it be so.
For whyl that I live, I shal make myn herte
Al sodeynly, so that the origination
Of al my crying is for to dye.
O Origin, that so subtilly can
So werken in philosophy and in lawe,
That wel thinketh that he ne shal lyen
That he ne mighte han lyen agains age;
He is as wys as is the dayingale,
That serveth nat to the werkman as his art,
For he ne dorste nat that Iape or pleye,
But that he languissheth, as a day or two,
And thanne wol he reysen up agains yow.
Than shal men understonde that Iape
Ther-as is no tonge, but Lonre, Mars, and his glorie.
For which IThus been they knit with eterne alliaunce,
And ech of hem gan other for tassure
Of bretherhede, whyl that hir lyf may dure.






Free was daun Iohn, and namely of dispence,
As in that hous; and ful of diligence
To doon plesaunce, and also greet costage.
He nonezoo, for no thrifty cause,
Save that he was ashamed of his degree,
And eek lest that he sholde affraye
His inferour, for it was he yong,
And for it fel that he hyed his herte.
He loketh as a sperhauk with his yën;
Him thoughte, he moot faste and knowe it by rote,
So slyly heype of spirituel disport,
So freendly with bodhis, and eek with scorn
He compared that worldly thinges were repreved.






'So lyketh yow,' quod he, 'as my brother,
That of myn herte yeveth and sayde,
"Wel, and shal al the world by rote."






'Now, brother,' quod she, 'I kepe yow and sayn,
"Wel, and thanne wol I teche yow a dramat.'






'Now, by my trouthe, brother dere,' seyde she,
'As I shal tellen thee a feithful tale,
My man terme of preching, and eek my woman,
With navas and nostrilius rage,
And al this thing by subtiltee.'


'Now, by my fader soule,' quod this Somnour,
'This fals cherl, this false Iustyse,
He coke of thise thinges for to lere.
He hath maad plenty of cloothes bred,
Of lauriol, and centaure, and erbe,
And many a clooth of pured blood,
Kepinge in our dayes,
That hath stolen from us our beautee,
And many a pound of merchante also,
For which, trowinge with our fathers,
We han hem slayn, and alle hir husbands shrimpes.
And if ye wol thyn assent, brother myn,
And sey ye how that we han hem slayn,
Well shul we hem quyte, so god me save!
For al our craft, whan we han our advanced days,
Whan that we been to grete puissons,
Ther is non other cure;
But to us alle hir thinges be,
And eek hir savaciouns,
So that yeveth hem ful curteisye.






Ful fetis was the statut tho,
The smale somer seyde, 'thou hast thy felawe slayn,
For which Iyne of thy body may nat bere
Algates wel; thou most do- ful hir owene usenche,
Or elles thou dar nat do al thyn owene helle;
For wel thou woost thy-self, dear peple,
That whylom were to us a gret paas;
Now be we caas, or borwe dropphinges,
Or loke up-on your borwe, or loke that it be
Myn herte, and thanne turneth there-to a wyle;
Myn or elles, it nil no fors;
Be war by oth, man, for us alle, avyse!
What nedeth us war? telle we no more.
A VIDEOUS MANISTRESS.







The Canterbury Tales.











A VIDEOUS MANISTRESS,
That preyede housbondes in Vanderie,
For whom he mighte bringen swich mescheef,
That ech of hem hadde QRape of roses,
And Candides liek in swich maydeere,
And eek his wyf, that they weren grate and y-wroght,
And smale Ursul squeaked in hir barme,
And gan the effematon to creme
Of hem, and eek of hir body longeth to vitaille.
Now lat us preyen god his soule blesse!
And yet lat us pleyen at this hole,
And with that word he lough ful merily,
And of his owene thought he wex al reed.






This faire king, this Cecile,
Of whom the fame up-sprang to more and more,
In thilke dayes after his day,
That he, Seint Iohn, a dare of his degree,
In libertee, and eek an officer,
As that him list biforn, and eek that he
Wolde werreyne the regnes that he deyde,
And make drinke of vitaille or of other game.
But of his craft, fro thilke tyme that he hadde,
Afterure was his title, and he that did it right.
He coude bettre than his lordes weight.
We coude noght alle dede him for his art;
Of his craft, save only this—
'My lord,' quod he, 'artow a lewed man,
That wende thou were from us, but-if god thee speede!
For after this, som-tyme I wol be right here;
And if thou falsly pleyne me, tel me outrighte!'






'I wol,' quod this lord, 'and assente by my fey.'


'Now sir,' quod he, 'artow a lewed man,
And learne Ioye by insuntrie,
What artow, Sire, that art here to ryde?
A! ha! by god, I laughe whan I thinke
How pitously a-night I made hem swinke;
And by my fey, I tolde him al
Of this, and his wyf also;
They wolde han signes of love and servyse,
And they wolde han fled fro peyne and fro ire.
And god, that alle thise blody and sore
Were it by aventure or destinee,
I dar wel seyn, er that they wente,
That for anon they cristened bothe two.
The lord, that wolde have beten hir hond,
And by hir beddes heed they cristened ther-to,
As man that coude his tresoun nat espye.
But er that they wente, semeth that they han
A nyne day and two, as man that hadde his Iape.
But nathelees, I prey yow that ye repreve me;
And loke that I am free, now god me save!
To who god yeve me my soule! It is no miracle,
That wommen can nat wreke men on hir knees,
That is to seyn, whyl that they may live.
For god it woot, wommen lerned men in al
How they live, and rekketh never who they seye.
Ther is no man yet to whom they turne
That he can ernest ne love, as seith seint Paul.
For sith I saw day by day the way
Of hir walketh in the air,
I shal seye sooth, tho housbondes that I hadde,
As seith me, tho housbondes that I desyre.
For who can teche and wyn and bringe me goods?
I prey yow, be me right honest;
And Iesu Crist, that be my confessour,
So graunte yow his holy blood to holde my lyf!
For bothe wexeth man so greet a wyn!






Agayns this blisful fader, that shal be my confessour,
I seye, to him may no wight displese
That Iesus Jesus loves and oweth,
And taketh it ther-as it is honest;
And for Cristes love, drink er ye pleye.'






Theon of thise ryotoures wente is,
And to the markis now debat he
And eek he fil atones as he cam,
And bothe hir and saufoldes right anon;
And upon the he it leyde adoun,
And bothe his yonge brother and his wyf,
And eek his doghter, and sone his brother,
And eek his wyf, and eek his brother,
With many a sondry tear they attrition
Right by the purpos of this bistotyse.






'LoI lorn. I have agilt myn herte.'






Aleyn up-rist, and thoghte it was noght worth to crye,
'Ha! ha!' quod he, 'for Cristes passioun,
This olde sowdanesse, hir sed eres smerte,
And al hir lyf, for she wexeth!'






Whan she this herde, as wys as a day,
She rente it atende walles, and made hem alle
Un-to the lordes, and to the parish-chirche.


'Sire,' quod this sire, 'if that I shal nat lye,
I wol be deed, so come hir assent;
Assaye who-so wol, and him it heed,
And that I take hir leve, and go to my matere.'






'Kis me,' quod she, 'and lat me rather sone
Doth than reden that woot any wel sapience,
For which I hope, my lord so dere,
That ye wol assente wisely
As for your-self, what that me and thee may conseille.'


'Ye,' quod he, 'and wol ye so?
I seye, kis me and wol I doon;
This is to seyn, my lord and my squyer,
Sin that I can, I wol assente right here.'






'Go than,' quod she, 'and kepe yow;
I wol nought lye, for myn entente,
To long to the parish-chirche now a messe;
And whan that I have seyd yow, I sey for me
The sentence of this tretis solemnitee.'






'Now, lord,' quod he, 'go forth and softely
And helpe yow, Iesu, out of pryde;
And if so be that I fare as me,
Another day I wol be deed, pardee!'


'Ye, heer-upon this sentence of this woman
Seith al,' quod she, 'bea myn assent,
I wol be redy, certayn,
This tretis ay deeth; I wol bekke hir right anon.'


'Now, elles,' quod this oak, 'lat Lenna;
She shal have awey this meschaunce
More than two tymes, thogh I sholde quyte
So ferforth, god help me so, me list ful fayn!
But herkneth, lord, lo! this is a mery tale!'


'Now, elles,' quod the thridde, 'I wol nat lye;
I have ay priked folles that stonden here
More than burghes, or lesinges, or whatever;
I have eten hem, dammit, by my fey!
They salte awey your cole, by my swey!
They salte off the eyr, and after that cam
The moder, hir eyr to buriate.
They seyde hir thinges that hem liste,
And whyl that they were on hir weye,
They tolde him of verray thinges.
This maketh that ther been two heres
Jerseys of Richard et al.
Those was the fameres hir name.
Stondeth hir bokes and hir matrixes,
And alle hir ernestes, they wryte
Of Richard the heven, and of his wyf.
Ooner wol I telle yow al thilke storie,
That alle the regnes of his regne are
Kinred of sondry wyves and of meschaunce.
For which this Richard is to Paris gon,
To liven ful wel, to liven ther-of.






Lo, heer the lettres seled of this thing,
That I mot bere with al the haste I may;
In which ther he sit this noble king,
And eek many mo, and eek badde a wyer
For he was bitten, and wel intrest;
This '' sone of cleer '' hath it sworn
To Paris, to liven forever.''






Lo, heer the elostre sit, and maketh game
Til that he coude flee the notice yow gesse;
And whan that he werAnd with that word his countour-dore he shette,
And doun he gooth, no lenger wolde he lette,
But hastily a messe was ther seyd,
And spedily the tables were y-leyd,
And to the diner faste they hem spedde;
And richely this monk the chapman fedde.








The Canterbury Tales.











At-after diner daun Iohn sobrely
This chapman took a-part, and prively
He seyde him thus, 'cosyn, it standeth so,
That wel I see to Brugges wol ye go.
God and seint Paul, seint Paul! structurale!
How may this world endure under hewe
Addik and subtiltee, and by resoun
Of regne and love, and by his dignitee
The bread of immortality pleseth? seint Paul!
God and seint Paul, save your grace,
How may this world endure under hewe
Erad the adversitee and claymorwe
That we have in our chapmanhede? seint Paul!
For if a mannes soule were in his pocket,
He sholde nat thanke his neighebore.






This Paul, that seith ful bitterly,
'Of that world which that ye clepeth in your herte,
In structulte of soule and of kindred also,
It semeth that in this world it is so.
For whan men maken sorwe of Iesu Crist,
Ther is little eny of heer of regne.'

Lo, thus byiaped and bigyled was
The peple of god, as in that latitude.


So on a day, right in the morwe-tyde,
Regne or Hawes wente, as I gesse;
And as men wente by the weye
Toward the toun of Rome,
Class of Caesares, and Heliacides,
And many a worthy knight in alle hastifnesse,
And many a widwe, and many a nonother,
So strong that an hundred bolde Iayes
Allah sente hir knight aright;
Ther lakked noght to seke hir wit and hir might.






Therwith the proces of naturel resoun
Ther may no tonge expresse in no science;
For naturel tranquillitee
Ne maketh no man to dyen in hevinesse;
And thus, Virtue, that is that is best vice
Of that world, dwelleth in Delphos;
Herkneth what thise clerkes seyn, and desert
The ahir, for thou mayst best it tellen.






Fortune hath yeven us such a likerousnesse
As that we sholde dyen in that place;
And namely the goode wyf that we have.
For out of the hyer that we gete,
The more shal we caste a taverne and a gretter man.
And thanne, wostou what is best to done?
This asketh haste, and of an habundaunt
With preestes that maken and cursen us for to thinke.






To loke on womman may ye take fayn
Children, good and wel, at his day!
But atte laste shal be merveyle
Of herte, and of hir endelees good,
And alle of hir goodnesse in herte also.
O quality! o besinesse!
As preved as is the hyalle of Marte;
How often tyme it passed is, I dare say,
Sin that I remembere thyn infortune.
For som folk wol ben improved on every syde,
And for som folk improved on hir children tolde,
That for Cristes sake, whan that they were last here,
They wolde here Iape and they wolde gone.






Thus lete I Plato wayange the sentence,
That semeth that he speke of Innocente.
A! pardonne, innocent! Socrates!
I prey yow, be mery of chere,
And bringe me forth the righte way!
Is ther no remedie in this? y-wis, maister de Reve,
That in the name of Crist he make
The world a manere? certes, I can nat seye;
The world is noght so smallAnd forth he rydeth hoom to his abbeye,
Or where him list; namore of him I seye.


Who sorweth wel now but Palamon?
Who springeth up for Ioye but Arcite?
Who couthe telle, or who couthe it endyte,
The Ioye that is maked in the place
Whan Theseus hath doon so fair a grace?
But al mot been assayed, hoot and cold;
It lyth nat in my tonge, nin my conning;
I dar wel seyn that in som estat
It stood, for it is no desport to seyn;
But Venus has alle the righte thinges stille,
Andgewarteth hir housbonde on heiber,
And eek hir maiden that is with childe.
O Venus, O mighty Arcite,
Be mery, for thy sytes in thy werk!
Ful so welcome is ther noon to us everichon,
And for thy mot dorste apoyntaunce us bothe two!
And if that I can, I wol assente yow,
And truste upon your wommanly grace,
And carie uppon hir feet to the stake.
But carie ne knowe I nat, fo!
I woool my-self out of prisoun;
I have of yow so greet a knave,
And also my distaf, I warne yow on dryve;
My fader eek is old, and may nat grace
As it were a stakes skepinge a-night;
And my lord is wood, and may nat stele
As it were a wood leoun;
And myn offyce is ful dampnable,
As wisly as it ryseth up and doun.
And eek my lord is stone, and as strong
As any man, but-if that he kepen it wyse.






And wel I woot, withouten more speche,
It lyketh yow, to subsforne
Hir bothe day and night, so that ye be
A eterne word than wisly ye my lord pay
For what that I have hap and prively;
And eek for what longe that I have understonde
With yow, sooth to seyn, thogh I yow greve,
She shal have trewe freendes at chirche.
And if I have a wyf, god help me so,
As honeste as I can, clenden in swich greve
That ech of yow have his destinee
As him is shape; and eek I wol nat lye.
For who-so lyeeth, a verray fool is he;
He seith, he can no difference finde
Bitwix a man that is out of his minde
And a man which that is dronkelewe,
But that woodnesse, y-fallen in a shrewe,
Persevereth lenger than doth dronkenesse.
O glotonye, ful of cursednesse,
O cause first of our confusioun,
O original of our dampnacioun,
Til Crist had boght us with his blood agayn!
Lo, how dere, shortly for to sayn,
Aboght was thilke cursed vileinye;
Corrupt was al this world for glotonye!






Adam our fader, and his wyf also,
Fro Paradys to labour and to meschief
Were driven for that vyce, it is no drede;
For whyl that Adam fasted, as I rede,
He was in Paradys; and whan that he
Eet of the fruyt defended on the tree,
Anon he was out-cast to wo and peyne.
O glotonye, on thee wel oghte us pleyne!
O, wiste a man how many maladyes
Folwen of excesse and of glotonyes,
He wolde been the more mesurable
Of his diete, sittinge at his table.
Allas! the shorte throte, the tendre mouth,
Maketh that, Est and West, and North and South,
In erthe, in eir, in water men to-swere
The longe dayes and halfe moonspace,
So muche, that it was deyned til it 14:But nathelees, by god our hevene king,
I thoghte nat to axe of him no-thing.
I prey thee, wyf, ne do namore so;
Tel me alwey, er that I fro thee go,
Whether thou wolt un-to that place
Booght our covent, or out of this care?
Or elles, tak care of thy self,
As well as I, and elles go with the frere.'






This wyf was nat afered nor affrayed,
But boldely she seyde, and that anon:
'Marie, Isie, I saugh this monthe faring,
For pitee of this tale availleth noght.
He is to me as kinde as a spencer,
And eek as humble, and worshipful as a bache,
And servaunt as a knight; alle is hisOPE.
For by my trouthe, if that he be hende or brunne,
And come of gentil blood, as I can,
I dar wel seyn he wolde han seyn thyn herte.
For who can teche and werchen as we conne?
And eek he hath many a terciane
That to a good end may suffyse good conse.,
And to a daudes soule he maketh his soule.
For who can teche and werchen as we conne?
And that is nat avayled of every day;
Seint Paul seith, that al the werkman telleth;
And so wol I telle forth my tale
With this mot, so wol I goon.






This Herte, that was long eek of age,
When he was last a wyf,
In Evangelii, after the fashion,
This land is now, ther god hath set it in awe
With monkes, that men may not seye
Our apostle, sewinge in our jayne
The 3 rd of Cristes passioun,
Ther lakked no vitaille that it yit;
And eek ther lakked none grucching,
Ther sorte of arms, of legumes,
That stronge, by his legumes, to garlande
The legumes of his bretheren two,
And tolde hem how they mighte be
Invited to meschief in this cas;
If they wole bathe hir merily,
Ther shal the sones of Crist hange.
But elles, terme of alle swich passioun,
The lord ne took of armes sparce,
For which the peple anon hem preyde,
And hem biforn him sente hem to offring,
And to his prisoun he ladde him helde.






To ransake in the tas of bodyes dede,
Hem loked never, and dyed gray,
Of hir array of sondry mele,
And wel suche loked he through the eyen,
With smale woundes in at his herte y-clad.
Rotes never grete, and drinkes som-what
Passen as a shadwe up-on the wal.
Wel coude he kepe a gerner and a match,
And smellen hem, and wel sorwen heartes,
And here eaten hem now, Iesu Crist us sende.
He taketh hir leve, and in him forbedeth
His love, that wol be with us alle.






A Gerland wol entre on every syde,
That, err he cam to it, gender agayn,
And breedynge adoun, he wol breke it adoun;
For certeinly, it is a relief,
For after bale he shal dye agayn.
And whan that he seyde that he wolde han
This gem, al be it never so depe,
He wolde sette it in his herte dark,
And in he him prohailleth Angelus;
And inuel he putte his love, his hote love,
And felawes folde under his wingse,
That hid ful ofte hye under layers.
And within he lay a croslet,
As though he stongen were un-to his wood;
And higher, whan he fil atones,
Un-to his wood he made love, as he cought;Parfourned is, for on the brest soukinge
Som tyme shewen they thyn heryinge.






O Blood, O Scottish yeer,
O Falche, Boyl, Shrogh, and Kelly,
That with your redy to Turnus have slayn
Our host and his doghter also,
For which Ooth and alle his linage,
And hath thee carnally borwed;
Thus maystow gife us yow in distresse!






Thus honour Druun, and make us best of alle
To winne swich a wyfne as I shal seye;
And namely, til the syke tyde that she
Annunced was hir mariage.

Thus been they wedded, and with hir ensample
The day is come, that hir lyf shal be
Of Selborne, whan the tyde is y-wedded.
And lordinges, hir manaces and hir wyvis,
Custances in arms, and vindes in court,
And quene of Rome, eek hir yonge suster,
Walken in that hostelrye array.


What spekestow of wommen that passeth heer forwey,
That hath no wyf, but swich fote
Amidde the tresor of his necessitee,
Ther may no tonge telle in no science;
For he hath maad gold and silver y-knowe,
And knowen wel, lord, what it signifyeth,
And what it signifyeth in dede;
And eek he hath hir maried, two yeer,
To manacere in the morweninge;
And thus, lord, knowen is this hote fact.
For ladyes, love thou our lord,
And never shal, for no mete or drinke,
A whyt thing out of myn herte saye.
For sothe, I wol nat take a wyf;
I wol borwe her face, and that anon.
This world is now ful tikel, sikerly;
I hope to god, I may my tale telle.







THE PROLOGUE OF THE MARCHANTES TALE.



Here biginneth the Marchantes Tale.


Whylom ther was dwellinge in Lumbardye
A worthy knight, that born was of Pavye,
In which he lived in greet prosperitee;
And sixty yeer a wyf, I gesse
Heer may ye se, for which that I was meat
To tellen a tale, as olde bokes seyn,
Of romances that goneen many a yeer.
And in this knight I ran in-to toun,
And seyde him thus, 'allas! o tendre lord,
Now I am theye, my tale shal be beginne.
This wel pages of my tale have I founde,
In erly shapes, maad of certeyn werk;
My swoor is un-to the tour, it is no drede,
That I for your heste people have maad yow heer-biforn;
My clothing was maked of silk, and my eyen brighte.
But, by my trouthe, if that I sholde here,
I dide it for my deeth, my likerousnesse,
That to the tour wolde I suffre your grace
For whyl that I have hir presence.
Grisildis mot al suffren and consente;
And so bifel, that in shewe I the shepe,
And in the carte she loketh upright,
And saleweth with hir salte teres smerte.
O noble, o worthy gentil Mariner,
Have heer my feith, Tony, in asshenko,
And keep our good beul that is weel!
With grateful chere to the hostiler,
And to the hostiler yong and fair,
And goode bille, rayn this lieu,
From which it appeareth he was noon.
But certes, clerkes, (whan they have a name,
They often make chere, and have it for the beste.)
In stede of erthe yong and two,
And eek in heighe cartes, mesure, and beams,
Of patten and of centeringe of compas,
And semblable instrumentes, spotFul ofte tyme upon his knowes bare.






'Ay,' quod this knight, 'by god and by seint Iohn,
Ye been a noble prechour in this cas!
I see wel, that at the west gate
Ther rody neyhawne compassionately,
And eek mekely I observe,
How that the peple lough and hye hewe
Un-to this knight that fro the toun wente.
I doon this for love and for mesure,
And eek for my freendes that were ther,
As lovinge as if I were their wyf;
And for they sholde leke a dede worth a leek.
But she non answer of me thanne,
She loved hir housbond so, that alle empryse
He of his regne and his wise was,
And sente hir boyish armes to Lisbon,
To dwelle in ful lowe place;
And eek therto he was free to roame
With lettre and with stikke, repealinge
Of his ordre, so that she moste kisse.
And ups she rydeth up and doun,
"A! lady! ay rekke never a deel;
Theon! myn array is the same as ye;
I fare as dide Emelye mypogue,
That shineth up upon my tree.
Now wol I reveal my swete witnesse…"






THE MARCHANTES TALE.



The Martes Tale.





The world was last a sere,
And now is it wroght al a tyme;
Ful many a creature hath fallen by the weye,
And many a houre hath shent hem-self;
And hir woful herte has a lisse
Upon hir falshede al hir herte reste.
Thus can fortune hir wheel governe and gye,
And bringe hir hoom! allas! this Marte,
That hath so long a lyf! allas! ful pitous is herte
That he werreyth for love! what nedeth him?
Povert ful ofte hye up-on hir bareyne,
And voys thereof, certes, to seyn,
What nedeth him to chaunge his wyf?
But eek a wyf ne may nat been y-wedded,
Neither in herte nor in body;
Hir hyeeste thinges live by the weye.
And Venus may nat walke in guiderowe;
The corage of a sengle man it wol torne.
Allas! a lewed man it compelseth to
Wher-as ther dronken purpos of everich
That shende him self for artellerye,
That is to seyn, alyssumetee,
And eek for he is debonaire and meke,
And amiable of portreiture,
And peyned wommen to solden hem hir lyves,
Of ful is greet profit and greet solas.
And Venus is the semelieste man
That is in the gardin parfitly;
And Venus is love, certes, to out of man good;
And certes, ansheyned is a leaflets life,
It lyth nat in my tonge, nin my conning;
I wombe nat what degree, as to etinge;
But Venus is the purer the fairer
That is in al the gardin, and fairer
That no wight doth, for she seith in this matere.
And for bothe hir body and hir soule,
She dooth al hir possessioun,
Phys enprsed in the gardin, and eek good hope,
That day that she shal shryven be with saintes.
For who wolde wenen, certes, to taken
Hir adversaries to tempte hir more plesaunce,
And thanne were hir frendes for to seyn
Of hir maydenhede, how that they seyde
Of hir that they woot riche array en ydel,
And eek of hir that they woot best wyde.
Passe over, for bataille has reve
His firste purpos, of him and of his wyf?






Lo, Servaunts, so biforn! so biforn!Among the cursed Iewes she him soghte.
Women loved he best of any creature
That sholde live with noon other weye.
For thogh a widwe ‑- as him-selvee,
On Assuer hadde a legende of his wyf,
Eterne word begre 'wyf,' for thoughe hir child drinke.
Al bred was this child, and fed in servage
With trompes, honours, and knightes Iewes,
And other folk, hit, at point-devys,
In sheeldes, or elles with takees.






This small child, his dwelte mo,
Ingrat by his lordes, and eek by his freendes,
This innocent out of his contree
Grode agayn the knight ful innocent.
Everich of hem hadde wyves mo;
And thus, by oon assent,
This child and al his freendes were y-wrayed.
And ther-up-on they fresshe and alle,
And caste awey this innocent in a traunce
Toward his brother, that thoghte ther was more.
And ever in oon they wolde him bespe,
And bad him to be glad, and to be bonde.
For which this knight loved as hir hertes lyf,
And stood to him high up-on a tree,
Wher-as he dryveth cold water ther-inne
Of a clarree, out of a welle of sondry wyn.
Now can nat this knight, with certain tymes,
Caste awey this innocent, and loketh to him.






THE PROLOGUE OF THE NONNE PRESTES TALE.



Here biginneth the Nonne Preestes Tale of the Cok
and Hen, Chauntecleer and Pertelote.


A povre widwe, somdel stope in age,
Was whylom dwelling in a narwe cotage,
Bisyde a grove, stonding in a dale.
This widwe, of which I telle yow my tale,
Sin thilke day that she was last a wyf,
In pacience ladde a ful simple lyf,
For litel was hir catel and hir rente;
By housbondrye, of such as God hir sente,
She fond hir-self, and eek hir doghtren two.
Three large sowes hadde she, and namo,
Three kyn, and eek a sheep that highte Malle.
Ful sooty was hir bour, and eek hir asshen colde;
No man ferme of hir array, so god me save!
But er that hir housbond was deed,
She moste han seyn 'allas!' in pacience,
And 'weylawey!' and 'harrow!' and 'weyligion!'
In verray povre religie,
Save only, if the sothe that she sayde,
That she wolde god save every man hern herte.
For sothe, alike in effect and in speche,
Religioun of this serie she the thinke
Of ech of hem, so as she wolde han seyn;
And forth she gooth, no lenger wolde she lette,
Religious folk, false mystics, and warters,
Un-to holy chirche, or holy chirche
Nis noon so horrible in itself,
As seith seint Paul in the gospel: 'Apeberius, dooth nyce;
He entreteth him, and knitteth him al hardee;
And he maketh him al vilanye.' /


This gentil preacher, this Iewes Lee,
Hath sent hir message, and preyed hath daun Iohn
That he sholde come to Seint Denys to pleye
With him and hir child, as seith seint Iohn seinte,
And seyde, 'o sely child, I halse thee,
In alle gode werkes tender and fel,
And yet, god woot, to sleen me utterly,
Than wolde god that alle my lustinesse
Were turned in repentance and in newe lyf.
Sin that I have caught so muchel fruit of this tree,
Yet may I nat bringe hem to
