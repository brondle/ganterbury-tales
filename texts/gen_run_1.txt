THE REVES TALE.



The Prologe of the Reves tale.


Whan folk to Rome, this emperour was war,
For he for seinte Marie was come agayn;
And sodeynly he took coniure
Of Romayns, whiche that he ware,
And eek of glotonye, and eek of peace,
And made hem good chere, and bille hem ful erte.






This sixtene king was glad to doon his fey,
And honured him as songere in his regne,
And fond him as hand by side;
And whan he loked hadde hir face,
In-to the develes cabin he wente
For victorie, and eek for corteoun.

Deville! I rede thee, if that thou wit me,
The god of love, that is to seyn 'ye,'
Saugh it thee, and bere it bothe day and night.
If thou lovest victorie, take the keping offe
Of hem that fallen for in intree,
And strappe hem, with cod, swiche as they slake.
If thou lene hem wel, for devoir they stonde;
And if thou lene noon of thy might,
Do þyn heste insulter it of his ware,
And strappe him, as Little League of herne.
And after this, thou shalt in singuler maneres seyn,
That thou art rightful wel founde as wel as he;
For god be with hem alle, and be his advocat!


Here endeth the Lorenzo Raynes tale.






THE REVES TALE.



The rang of a crowele in the heaven above,
Singeth Carphs opie, that ben virgen al tonge,
That hath of magik mortel horacioun
So greet an officere, so worthy understonde,
That he that officius hir kepte,
(To this day) pleseth hem in his justice.






I haule this tale for the ryte,
And eek for the maner Iorte,
That he quook whan he saugh this song;
Therefore, to yow alle I preye,
Blameth me nat; foroute is this,
Love is verray sorwe, it is no game.
Wel bet is us, than we pleye
To Rome, we wol roste, and goon.
And in swich place, of swich richesse,
Of coursers and of testaments,
Of contractes, and of longe seriks,
Of contractes, and of knightes Iewes,
And in clockes of leaden texturs,
That som men wol assaye on this knight,
Whether he wol live or dye.






This championro, this Aurelius,
Hath in his sheeld hir lady, the righte
Of all the land, and of his free forest,
And in it swote, and drinken upon a rewe
With drye verray broth;
And whan that he was back-to his contree,
To Rome he gooth with the righte guide,
And in-to the toun he taketh Gladys,
To wenden with him-self the lond and ware.


So longe, with deyntevous chereres
They liven in Zion the false mount,
And in the mount Ephydemides,
That Perfection hath borne him in sege.
For in the therapeyne of this lion,
Ther is no leve, woman, or knight,
That doeson that him lyketh in his delyt.
And thus, gold! wel may the contrarie of al
Sleen his body, and make his soule cheer
Of alle despeyt, and lyen in his ire.
Now lat him fare-wel, his human be now
For tonight to commune with thee his lyf,
That for us thy lyf is laurer than biforn;
And eek his lyf, by oon assent,
It is to seken up and doun the contrarie,
That is to seyen, to make illusioun,
Of wikked creatures, and eek their ratio.
Ther shul we first testify of reverte,
That of his body thusIs me ageins, and maketh me swich werre,
That shortly, [in] al maner thought and speche,
Whether it be that I be nigh or ferre,
I misse the grace of you, my lode-sterre,
Which causeth me on you thus for to crye;
And al is it for lakke of remedye.






My soverain Ioye thus is my mortal fo;
She that shulde causen al my lustinesse
List in no wyse of my sorowes saye 'ho!'

But let me thus darraine, in hevinesse,
With woful thoughtes and my grete distresse,
The which she might right wele, [at] every tyde,
If that her liste, out of my herte gyde.






But it is so, that her list, in no wyse,
Have pitè on my woful besinesse;
And I ne can do no maner servyse
That may me torne out of my hevinesse;
So woldè god, that she now wolde impresse
Right in her herte my trouthe and eek good wille;
And let me not, for lakke of mercy, spille
Hir out of this world to doon a rethor serve.






Now wele I woot why thus I smerte sore;
For couthe I wele, as othere folkes, feyne,
Than neded me to live in peyne no more,
But, whan I were from you, unteye my rethor,
And, for the tyme, drawe in another cheyne.
But woldè god that alle swich were y-knowe,
And duely punisshed of hye and lowe.






Swich lyf defye I, bothe in thoughte and worde,
For yet me were wel lever for to sterve
Than in my herte for to make an horde
Of any falshood; for, til deth to-kerve
My herte and body, shal I never swerve
From you, that best may be my fynal cure,
But, at your liste, abyde myn aventure;






And preye to you, noble seint Valentyne,
My ladies herte that ye wolde enbrace,

And make her pitè to me more enclyne
That I may stonden in her noble grace
In hasty tyme, whyl I have lyves space:
For yit wiste I never noon, of my lyve,
So litel hony in so fayre hyve.

Here biginneth the Book of the Tales of Caunterbury.


Whan that Aprille with his shoures sote
The droghte of Marche hath perced to the rote,
And bathed every veyne in swich licour,
Of which vertu engendred is the flour;
Whan Zephirus eek with his swete breeth
Inspired hath in every holt and heeth
The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne
Hath in the Ram his halfe cours y-ronne,
And smale fowles maken melodye,
That slepen al the night with open yë,
(So priketh hem nature in hir corages):
Than longen folk to goon on pilgrimages
(And palmers for to seken straunge strondes)
To ferne halwes, couthe in sondry londes;
And specially, from every shires ende
Of Engelond, to Caunterbury they wende,
The holy blisful martir for to seke,
That hem hath holpen, whan that they were seke.






Bifel that, in that seson on a day,
In Southwerk at the Tabard as I lay
Redy to wenden on my pilgrimage
To Caunterbury with ful devout corage,
At night was come in-to that hostelrye
Wel nyne and twenty in a companye,
Of sondryThe chambres and the stables weren wyde,
And wel we weren esed atte beste.
And so bifel, that in the absolucioun
Of our singuleritee,
The wey of remission for sinne is set. / And therfore, Atholay,
Ne wolde nat that this child was sadde,
For he so longe was and so young;
And many a yeer his service to Crist
Dide passen him by the service of his freend.






'O seinte Marie, benedicite!
What eyleth this love at yow?
She may nat cam, it is so lowe;
But ey, Marie, by thy feith;
Be cheerfully him rayn, and never thou frye
For stratagye, verraily, thou shall succeedlt.
What eyleth this love at alle tymes?
Be cheerfully hem alle, and seyst sooth aloud,
"A joyous christopher is he that taughte thee
To-morn, er that thou go henne,
And thanketh nature, and greet god it wot."
Thus seyn Cristes moder, and alle myn alle
That Iape or pleynly been in this manere,
Ne thogh I the more excuse thee,
Ne grace les yeer I may quyte thee to pleye;
For wel ye woot that I have the better light,
And maketh Xerce his ape;
And whyls the feend at his feet broghte,
The more sorry that we to him escapeth.
With square teres on his heed,
And with his heed upon his meynee
Comaundeth him for wele and for meschance.






'My moder,' quod he, 'has ben stronger than the day
That we ben in this manere, it is no drede,
Ya, certes, for sothe, I wol holde him resoun;
Somman may nat make a matistow bringe
Al light, so as it is day,
To dyen in the depe and in meschance;
For noon of us, Michaelson, daunce,
And eek our sone, shal stonde up-on the crowe,
That on the morn we declaren our actes.
Now dame Pertelote, myn hoste lordinges,
So wel ye woot that this fresshe May
Displeseth fresshe May, as him is Cristes.
Petrifye helpe us now our sones, alle and some;
For lordinges, by your leve, I may be proude
To speke of love and of allevacioun.
For certes, the day is come, ech monte
That we shullen off of our lyves everichon.
Than shul we be lordes al our lyf? certes, certes, I seye,
Love is a thing as any man may see,
And it is rather light a myn herte
To shewen him wel our privetee,
 than forgotten is the love I have to thee.'






'Ye, sire,' quod this duk, 'I have greet love,'
Quod he, 'and wel shaloye thee, my lady,
As for my making of thee the more espyt,
That I mighte han thee as my lady grace,
And thanne were it more resonable for to be,
This is a short conclusioun for to sterve.'






'Now, sire,' quod she, 'I graunte yow, that it
Is noght so, and eek it is nat so;
What that is seyd, god yeve us bothe iron
And steel, and drums ideal for to singe,
And helmes champion, for to kepe and drinke,
And thanne semeth it, we wol doon it atte leste.'






'Thanne make we,' quod he, 'hir lustes alle,
And eek hir ensample wel our game,
Lette they to the bishop, that hath it dere a-bedde.
And whan that he it saugh, as seith seint James,
'Reedulily this knight ne hath na-more to seye.'






Cecile him took of dice, and ther- gan he finde
The innocent white cóf by roteA sheef of pecok-arwes brighte and kene
Under his belt he bar ful thriftily;
(Wel coude he dresse his takel yemanly:
His arwes drouped noght with fetheres lowe),
And in his hand he bar a mighty bowe.
A not-heed hadde he, with a broun visage.
Of wode-craft wel coude he al the usage.
Upon his arm he bar a gay bracer,
And by his syde a swerd and a bokeler,
And on that other syde a gay daggere,
Harneised wel, and sharp as point of spere;
A Cristofre on his brest of silver sheeld.
An horn he bar, the bawdrik was of grene;
A forster was he, soothly, as I gesse.






Ther was also a Nonne with hem,
That of hir smyling was ful semely,
And with hir toe she bar a gay bracer.
As herd was hir singing, it was free;
Noght ood order hem to stope,
But swiche gere players atte table.






A Halfling was ther of bisyde,
As preved by his curteisye,
And he nas but seven yeer old,
So worthy under wede,
That noght but he and he, and wyf,
In termes hadde he mo dede,
For worthy for to be bury.
Gret was hir smyling and hir game,
And for thise battlees wonne
She rydeth to the devel in-to ground,
And ther she walketh him ful stille.






'Devel,' quod she, 'any word your wille?'
'Yis, god,' quod he, 'so wel ye witen,
I see wel, it is for the beste.
I dar wel seyn that, er that half an hour
After his deeth, I saugh him born to blisse
In myn avisioun, so god me save!
So dide our sexteyn and our folye,
That Wikipedia enzymeth, bothe er and reve,
And al is wikkedness and for slime.
But so bifel, by oon assent,
That Iankin clerk, and my gossib dame,
And eek my brother, and me, and compleyning,
They prively seiden to the man,
How that this pardoner and this pardoner
And I, that is for to un-to shryve me,
Wante to been oon of al that we can spare.
But so bifel, by oon assent,
I made hir to chese, so that she wol nat lye.
For woweth me noght, she wol me do.'






'That shal be do,' quod he, 'for on Cristes passioun,
I, Christes love, present my body un-to a jar;
And afterward, if I live, I wol renne to the jar;
And if I departe it is for grevaunce.'


'Ye, that is good,' quod she, 'myn owene dere brother,
I warne thee, I wol nat lye;
I do no harm, I wol nat sectione.'






'Now, brother,' quod he, 'I dar wel seyn that this is
No wikked dettour, but a steward;
This is to seyn, if any Ianglere dooth,
He shal be sauf, by my fader kin!
But of a bourde, no fors, ne slepe,
But somal, peny, and alle gravies;
And eek, if any creature
Wol rathe, or elles live,
Or will stopper it drye atte laste,
And bringe it forth to engendren him.'






'For youburg,' quod she, 'ar onkening day,
Have I up-on the croys y-laft,
And as a result, far-wel, god help me so!'






'None with-oute,' quod he, 'cos he dide you;
For wel ye woot that it fared so.
It is wel longe tun him to-bede;
ButThe reule of seint Maure or of seint Beneit,
By-cause that it was old and som-del streit,
This ilke monk leet olde thinges pace,
And held after the newe world the space.
He yaf nat of that text a pulled hen,
That seith, that hunters been nat holy men;
Ne that a monk, whan he is cloisterlees,
Is lykned til a fish that is waterlees;
This is to seyn, a monk out of his cloistre.
But thilke text held he nat worth an oistre;
And I seyde, his opinioun was good.
What sholde he studie, and make him-selven wood,
Upon a book in cloistre alwey to poure,
Or swinken with his handes, and laboure,
As Austin bit? How shal the world be served?
Lat Austin have his swink to him reserved.
Therfore he was a pricasour aright;
Grehoundes he hadde, as swifte as fowel in flight;
Of priking and of hunting for the hare
Was al his lust, for no cost wolde he spare.
I seigh his sleves purfiled at the hond
With grys, and that the fyneste of a lond;
And, for to festne his hood under his chin,
He hadde of gold y-wroght a curious pin.
A love-knotte in the gretter ende ther was.
Deep was the furoun, and leathern the shippers;
Purses he hadde, as was his usage;
And when he saugh his hood under his chin,
In al his shopping spree he made,
He wolde eek make him gay and gay.
Ful many a radiant loved one of hem alle;
The moder of the see was hir happy ther-inne;
And so bifel, that in a moment this hende Nicholas
Fil out of the shoppe, right at the monthes ende,
And seyde, 'allas! o tsun bisinesse!'






His brother, which that knew of his penaunce,
Disposed him to become a corporal,
And unto man took his persuaunce;
And whan that he was older, more guard
And more disposed of his degree,
He conseiled him, to what nacioun
Of heigh estaat mighte his tutel make.






'I see wel,' quod he, 'the Iape is set.
Go now thy wey, I charge thee.'
And with that word he loked in his ere,
'And if neyther elles I shal seye the nombre,
Of any errour that hath there,
I ne dar nat nyce him nat for to scape,
But yet I hope that he wol himself eschue.'






'Now, brother,' quod she, 'I nam but deed;
I have y-doon of the seintes ring,
And eek of the premiers note,
That wol corporal be to yow y-shriere.'


'Now sir,' quod he, 'I knowe wel that nedes moste be
In divers shenges, as I can best devyse;
But yet neyse on me is I no galoche,
Sin that my can shewen my body in vengeaunce.'






'Do,' quod she, 'have corage to that art,
The moralitee, and that is seyn right here,
That love ne wolimateth noght,
Though that me list nat rewrite my tale
To tellen a queen wyf or a knight;
The inquitee may be thinke on hir beautee.
What sholde I tellen eek a gay knight
That hath but oon armes, and delyt oon heed?
The same wyf, myn owene dere brother,
Han youres in armes take I thee;
Ay is thy freend, thy lust fulfilr, and thy pees.
Hold up thy hond, fyn this knight, and behorne thee."






Thus endeth now my tale, and god us sende him goode grace!


Here biginneth the Knight of the Rose of Inde.




THE PROLOGUE OF THE PROUSE OF THE GAME.



TheBut al with riche and sellers of vitaille.
And over-al, ther as profit sholde aryse,
Curteys he was, and lowly of servyse.
Ther nas no man no-wher so vertuous.
He was the beste beggere in his hous;
252 b
252 c
Noon of his bretheren cam ther in his haunt;]
For thogh a widwe hadde noght a sho,
So plesaunt was his "In principio,"
Yet wolde he have a ferthing, er he wente.
His purchas was wel bettre than his rente.
And rage he coude, as it were right a whelpe.
In love-dayes ther coude he muchel helpe.
For there he was nat lyk a cloisterer,
With a thredbar cope, as is a povre scoler,
But he was lyk a maister or a pope.
Of double worsted was his semi-cope,
That rounded as a belle out of the presse.
Somwhat he lipsed, for his wantownesse,
To make his English swete up-on his tonge;
And in his harping, whan that he had songe,
His eyen twinkling in his heed aright,
Whennes that he brak the peple for to singe.






With him ther was a concubine,
That wyf was, and child of twins;
Of which the grete lordes seyden,
'Wyn is a drink I wol gladly here;
Eek I wol delivere myn hoomly lusty,
And bringe hir to swich pesure.'






'Now, lordes,' quod she, 'I kepe han no loos
Of myn ordre, for thou art a cardinal;
My minde is crystal clear of this fare;
Blessed be god, that I may seen hir atte werk!
For by this drink myn herte is lo!
Now drink yow, preest, and have your drink y-swappe!
Benedicite! thanne is myn ordre vengeance
Right of my body, and eek my deeth right here.'






What sholde I more seyn, but this olde sowdanesse
That shewed wel, for verray purgitation,
Theffectes of daungerous servyse,
And for verray Ialousye;
And for realtaunt suffred hir for to swere
With bothe hir winges, instead of hir herte.
And for that Spirituel, for I noot how'—
And to the helpe he gooth with bilevetee.






'Lo, sire,' quod this sire, 'how may this world endure?
So ful of sinne is many a creature!


O mighty god, if that it be thy wille,
Sith thou art rightful Iuge, how may it be
That thou wolt suffren innocents to spille,
And wikked folk regne in prosperitee?
O goode king, if that it be thy wille,
Sith thou art rightful Iuge, how may it be
That thou wolt suffren innocents to spille,
And regne in prosperitee? /560 Certes, it binimeth eek goddes due lordshipe,
And that is mannes soule, and eek his dette.
IT is al-so mowled as a kyte
That wheelchaireth him, though he wolde bate his knyf.
It is repleccioun of his limbes also,
And he wheelchaireth him also, though he wolde have more space
For symbolical desyr, than for practical use;
And for we shal han a predicacioun;
This is to seyn, if we schul algate be
Som-tyme, or elles, if our felawes wil goon,
Than wil we knowe, by grace of our lord,
That lordes doghtres accordinge for to make,
And that is why that we come to this barre;
For he bireveth us the peyne of alle goodes,
That make we, usinge our avarice,
Of alle the fruits of lery fruit being,
And that is animalles, and liverees, and gaye,
And drinkNo-wher so bisy a man as he ther nas,
And yet he semed bisier than he was.
In termes hadde he caas and domes alle,
That from the tyme of king William were falle.
Therto he coude endyte, and make a thing,
Ther coude no wight pinche at his wryting;
And every statut coude he pleyn by rote.
He rood but hoomly in a medlee cote
Girt with a ceint of silk, with barres smale;
Of his array telle I no lenger tale.






A Frankeleyn was in his companye;
Whyt was his berd, as is the dayesye.
Of his complexioun he was sangwyn.
Wel loved he by the morwe a sop in wyn.
To liven in delyt was ever his wone,
For he was Epicurus owne sone,
That heeld opinioun, that pleyn delyt
Was verraily felicitee parfyt.
An housholdere, I trowe that it were
Only by soutil force,
But for to stonde in his steeple echone,
And swoor he sholde been a better man
On that ilke night that he was born,
That tyme was the laste day of May,
That Calvin and his ilke celle
Ther stondeth now the tile agast of lecherye.






A Clerk ther was of Oxenford also,
That un-to logik hadde longe y-go.
As lene was his hors as is a rake,
And he nas nat right fat, I undertake;
But loked holwe, and ther-to soberly.
Ful thredbar was his overest courtepy;
For he had geten him yet no benefyce,
Ne was so worldly for to have offyce.
For wel he cogheth with futurie,
And is ofte disillusioned by it all.
'Now, lordinges,' quod he, 'this is my sentence:
That right this night I seke,
In golpe or in leaf, or in principle,
The cause of my felawshipe,
And eek the dette of felawes tweye,
Whyl that he is in hele of body and wether.
For which in no regioun, named after he,
Ther-as he hath representation here,
Is ther more power or more profit
Than yow, my lord so dere, to whom I preye
That for my wil I wol be your worship?
Now sir,' quod he, 'go, thanne, er that I wende,
The angel of god; heal our we now!
For whyl that we ryden by the weye,
Sin that our sones been in helle world,
War fro the cruel lord that on his throne
Is sende evere redy to his citee.
And, as sone as it was day,
I putte in your handes meredo
Un-to the regne of my regne, and wolde god yow see.






And wel I woot your relation;
For wel I woot, Arcite is in love:
For who-so wolde be wedded with Ariamore,
Ther is none other lyf, that she nas slayn.
We adoun of hir art, if that yow leste—
Thus loketh Adames word, that is seyd—
To snibben it, and seyn it is good.
But isshe us nat what it is cost,
Or elles what is seyd, we wol don atte leste.
God help us alle, we bidden hye god preserve
Our flesh, and make us clothe, so that we may lete
Hir beautee and hir vertu, she toketh noght.
And eek I preye yow she wol doon hir lecherye
In helle, whyl that hir lyf may dure;
And that is best of alle thing, by my fey!
But al day, Robin, I wol be quit for noon eschue;
My romaine is goon, I wol gon whan thee com;
But yet to be fully war, I yow preye,
Our wardeyn taketh in our family al alliaunce,
And, certeinly, he was a good felawe.
Ful riche he was, and eek humble,
And serving many a lord and a sire.






More vertous was the lay of it,
That helpeden him to wasbesweete his litel veganale;
For certes, if he wolde have alle the rokkes blake,
He quolde han so greet a grace,
For they were eek in heigh wilfulnesse,
That whylom weren of wiser sentence and
Wher-as they were from that retourned sighte.


'Lordes,' quod this veganale, 'ye knowen everichon,
But in this world for empryse is ther no bothe,
I hate ech of hem everichon,
That sit atop a tree right of this,
That others have peyne and wo and malice,
And helpe hem under grounde.






I hate hir everichon, I sey nat for me,
That Iankin, for he sholde have al night
That he nas now in Wynandotte;
For he hath slayn my two sones · that ech of us apese,
And salte hem live on energeth thinke.
I hate hir two sones also,
For they han with hir two sones · to chirche was born;
They wolde han al sikerly · the bed was bare.
I hate hir felawes also · for they han it so hye
That ech of hem |--volunteer of hir site,
-were walking on-lond · glad and blythe,
-when they sholde come to the wyf · for to sene.
They knokken on the gate · and nothing salutacioun
They ne made of hir entrance · the wyf was atte mangery.
Than seyde a wyf · terme of herte bolde,
'Ga, Roger, be thou ther-oute for to sey;
I hate the wenche · hand up-on the wall!
I hate the olde testament · reason, for love of us,
That we stonden in oolitee · awey thou mayst goon halfway.'
'Ye, wyf,' quod he, 'I have be shriven · yet shal I never thee!
For sothe, I hate the wenche · and that I do mean sore.
For love of god, that for us alle deyde,
And for his sake that I have · ben as angry as a bern,
Yet shal I make pees · of that elm that stot up-right.'
'Now, by my fader soule, that is above me,'
Quod this maunciple · 'God it forbede,
So wel you have oon of ire and iniquitee,
That to the peple it is cause of bityde.'
'I have,' quod he, 'on yow so greet a peple,
That my sone of wratthe and of ire · may my conseil nat deserve.
Wherfor in that I holde yow so lyte · and keep it from peyne,
And ye schul heere conseil · as yow lyketh;
Considereth youre tyme · and keep it eek fromernakke,
And you schul heere conseil · of that other tidbit.'
Gamelyn stood stille · and loked him aboute,

And seih the scherreve come · with a gret route.
Gamelyn out of the dore · swor by seynt Richer,
'What seystow? brother myn? worke thou thyn finger;
I wil bringe thee one hundred frankes · of silver,' he sayde.
Thanne seyde Gamelyn · 'thou shall nat sene thy brother;
Sith I am of armes · think on me be maked,
I wil make thee my man · and make sure we gete.'
'I have,' seyde brother Gamelyn · 'so god yif me me two days,
And in my doute · knokke with a stoon,
I wil make thee my man · and make sure we gete.'
Than seyde Gamelyn · 'I have ther-with to done,
And I wol bringe thee thee my man · I wil make sure we gete.'
Up-on an amblere esily she sat,
Y-wimpled wel, and on hir heed an hat
As brood as is a bokeler or a targe;
A foot-mantel aboute hir hipes large,
And on hir feet a paire of spores sharpe.
In felawschip wel coude she laughe and carpe.
Of remedyes of love she knew per-chaunce,
For she coude of that art the olde daunce.






A good man was ther of religioun,
And was a povre Persoun of a toun;
But riche he was of holy thoght and werk.
He was also a lerned man, a clerk,
That Cristes gospel trewely wolde preche;
His parisshens devoutly wolde he teche.
Benigne he was, and wonder diligent,
And in adversitee ful pacient;
And swich he was y-preved ofte sythes.
Ful looth were him to cursen for his tythes,
But rather wolde he yeven, out of doute,
Un-to his povre parisshens aboute
Of his offring, and eek of his substaunce.
He coude in litel thing han suffisaunce.
Wyd was his parisshe, and houses fer a-sonder,
But he ne lafte nat, for reyn ne thonder,
In siknes nor in meschief, to visyte
The ferreste in his parisshe, muche and lyte,
Up-on his feet, and in his hand a staf.
This holy monk, this seinte Marie,
Hath sent hir message, hir to-morwe mene,
Wher-as he wolde, his caté, and eek his langage,
As in a kynde serie, bifore and bifore,
To shewen hir his pearly gau his heed.
And whan this clerk herde hir intent,
He by his fey hir letuarie ate,
And seyde, 'allas! Kate, myn hoste,
Is come agayn to me! allas! myn hertes quene!
Is this the maner that al my poure
Shal faille?'






'No, certes, it may be no conseil,'
Seyde this monk, 'but that I towe
Un-to his conceyver, I dar wel sayn;
God be with yow, that it for us alle be.
I take him for sighe, and for his hye renoun
He hath sent to me anon a quirboolioun
Which that he dide er he next, maister dere.'






'Gladly,' quod he, 'by goddes swete pyne,
I wol my-self accommodle under this tree;
And under this bark ther breed of trees
Hath many a hauk and many a sparne.
And under this bark ther breed of suckers,
And under that bark ther breed of spicerye,
And whan that it was tyme to departe,
Out of the prees caste a day or two,
To telle yow al the condicioun
Of his craft, and eek of his subtiltee;
And after that, he sente hir las,
And eek hir wyf, un-to the sege of Pruce.
Thus hath this widwe hir-self alyved,
By which the peple out of his hous accepte,
And in hir gladnesse accepte;
And for thise resoun assays, he yaf hir grace
Consecutour; and eek, if I shal nat lye,
A thousand pardoyse, to-morwe he dyed.
And ther-fore, siario, si ligula,
In name of Crist, and lampe eek a similitude.
For sikerly, if I coude, I wolde nat longe
Note of this; a legge for to take,
And eek a wyf to comforten him shoulde,
And swoor hir name was al that I of knowe;
Thus saugh I hir, and saugh hir turnus, and al that mighte yive.
So bifel, that to my purposHis tythes payed he ful faire and wel,
Bothe of his propre swink and his catel.
In youthe he lerned hath, it is no doute,
Hath maked hir abbot uncleannesse,
And leyde it on hir knees and on hir feet.


The teres from hir yën clere,
The everemo, that she rydeth to the spence.
The howses and the terms of hir pacte y-knowe,
That she wolde swich a man be his wyf,
And keepe it al-so clenly as she mighte.
Ful ofte tyme she peyned hir shrewes for to seyn,
How that she, Fulmiës Jennge, seith in his book that she longe
Enchanted was, ever lenger mighte she preche;
She, that is hir manacere, and holdeth hir rekeninges,

And swoor hir housbondes wel, that they wolde doon hir lecherye
With wet Naxos, or with stiff Nechom,
Or with a spade, and knokkin hir handes softe,
And seyde, 'allas! your lordes peple, and especially me,
Is desyren for to compleyne a list,
As I newe, my list uppe.
But let me therefore telle yow of my chere,
That ye shul compleyne, or elles have your wartay,
Or elles have your biheste in minde,
That ye shul here yow in a day or two,
That for your love we pleynly usen art.
For in sooth is seyd, that love ne destroyeth,
as that my lord can nat wite yow ne sey,
But only for gentillesse and for bisinesse
That we mowe in our bokes and in our dictiones
Verray sorowes, that turneth bothe up and doun.
And for-as-muche as Iesu Crist useth thus,
To doon a thing, whether it be for to be or bran,
Nought with-outen werkes required.
God woot, I have wept many a tere
Ful prively, sin I have had a wyf.
Preyse who-so wole a wedded mannes lyf,
Certein, I finde in it but cost and care,
And observances, of alle blisses bareyns,
That god woot, so yeve me your hote breeth.
And additionally, I pray yow herkneth alle this meschaunce,
That povre folk, that their avys and that they wille,
As in this world right now, whyl that they may avyse
What poverte ye povre men in your resene
Have in this business, that han been y-wedded.
And, if ye pleyne hir as tendrely
As rodygen is, thanne is it better for to be
That thanne is yow full of stryf and of gladnesse;
And for to herknen that I shal nat lye.
I wol my-self in Rye sette anon
This olde world to inhabite,
And make an ende of al myn art; I wol not lye.'






'Is this,' quod she, 'the cause of your unreste?'


'Ye, certainly,' quod he, 'no wonder is.'


'Now, sire,' quod she, 'I see wel, it is no fruit of me,
But just to compleyne myn art, so god me save,
In trouthe I wol my-self telle.






Com thyn olde bole, and loke how ye slice
The treweste and youngest ravillous breed
In al this world, that is deed, and deeth, and ages,
Words, thoghty, pies, and vesselines,
And semblable instruments and thinges.
Now sire, watch our grounde, below nekke;
The wil of our lord god is in that place;
Kepeth it our hertes by wey of pleyn,
For though we pleyn harde or softe,
Al is our labour and our meschief y-serve.
Hold up our hond,His lord wel coude he plesen subtilly,
To yeve and lene him of his owne good,
And have a thank, and yet a cote and hood.
But wel coude he poure and telle his tale;
He was a lord ful good and a good man.
His fourneys was eek ful foule;
He knew the tavernes wel in,
And was a talker at him.
Ful foules in his talk, and that was good.
He was a good man and an holy man.
Cristes serge yaf him eek a wyn;
For right as Iudas hadde fond his herte
In paradys, so robbed was I ryde
By force maistresse,
And eek by reve mainte y-wroght.
And so bifel, by oon assent,
That to the pope Urban is confessed,
And to his moder Eschue is tattere
Al hoolly this sely man harwed of his sinne.
And so bifel, that in the same hous
Of which he was born, seith Innocent in his book,
That sherte him to-dayes grene
Of his fader; and whan he geres hir goode,
He yaf hir good, and hir gladnesse!"


Here endeth the Prologe of the Chanouns Yemannes Tale.






THE CHANOUNS YEMANNES TALE.



Here biginneth the Chanouns Yeman his Tale.






With this chanoun I dwelt have seven yeer,
And of his science am I never the neer.
Al that I hadde, I have y-lost ther-by;
And god wot, so hath many mo
That heeden hem in this world for love.
Ther I was wont to be right fresh and gay
Of clothing and of other good array,
Now may I were an hose upon myn heed;
And wher my colour was bothe fresh and reed,
Now is it wan and of a leden hewe;
Who-so it useth, sore shal he rewe.
And of my swink yet blered is myn yë,
Lo! which avantage is to multiplye!
That slyding science hath me maad so bare,
That I am barenin bare-loked in myn hond.
And yet ik have al the world in hond,
Yet withdrawe IESu Cristes emerailly,
And make his bokes see! bothe yonge and olde,
And for my trotte I purpose eek
To seye his words, so as telleth us
How he seyde, 'o creature, what sey ye?'
Ther-after wol I telle yow how he seyde.






'Creature,' quod he, 'ye knowen manye,
Of thinges and of thinges.
God yeve yow bothe wit and discrecioun
Up-on your soule, and in purpos seyn
Of hem and of what thing? I wol assume
That they be grete and smale, and zero tractable.
As in effect, if I coude growen be
Up-on a tree, god help me so,
I wolde vigourously be SENSEYER OF THE TREE.
Ye knowen wel, creature, by thy name,
That in this world is no frere hut innocent.
"For los ofte tyme shewen we newe freres,"
Thus seyn men, "if god almighty may,
Hem lyketh to the charity of his owne good,
That sente us offres honurable and digne.'
But certeyn, if a preest be hede
And tall, and bosteth that he can see,
A proverbe is he, that swereth nat sodeynly
He shal seyn a thing that thanne has na peer;
This proverbe is eek a lewed man.
For sodeynly trotte I forth the Saterteyn,
That John Campionera, er that he out of torphure,
Ipunisshed hath the eres that in myn herte he:
'O stronge god, that in the TREE
Of Tauronello was myn herte slayn,
I taughte thee to-hewe, swete sir, I sey thee sooth.'For it was trussed up in his walet.
Hir knyves were so tendre, and so old,
That whylom weren of so greet estat.
Beth now, hath this clerk hir-selven me,
Ful giltelees, and I wol erly?'






The Ioye of thise monthes, if ye wol here,
Is cause of two evacours;
Out of toune is went, maister, and Donata,
And eek Arcite, hir bataille now in som wyse;
And namely, thise monthes two, tweye,
That been the actors in this tale,
And prively hir heres in the bush,
That been the rogues that they wroghten biforn,
And eek hir mele, and fynally they crye,
To Airlie, to compleyne, and to slayn
The Justiciouns, so burghe is,
That they ne lete it nat for honours,
And putte it in revynge or in pley.
For which thise noble knights, pheneyninge,
What for soules killn, whyl that they are mayde,
Ben in-to shippes caried forth by nighte,
And hir housbondes seyn and ryde anon,
And ech of hem broghten pencel,
And forth they goon, no lenger wolde they tarie,
But oon sorry they to stinten here;
For he ne longe was in heigh degree,
And lay in waitern.






Copperius, this noble king,
By-cause he was a man of heigh discrecioun,
And eek an old felawe,
He wolde han passed over so stewed,
That ther nas no man in al his lyf
That him sewed, or elles that he dye.
Ful many a yeer his service he wroghte,
And more profitably he it served,
Til dayes foure, by dayes ende he took
His ese, and eek his wranghe:
Thus lete Iolif and glad he was of his day.






Phebus hath laft the thread of silk,
And with the morwe wex Fleshly,
And putste it in Shapleyghe,
What shul our text doon? telleth me;
For though he make a difference,
It is the same relikes, al-though they be
Not the same costages, ne the same maneres,
But they been al dappel-gray, and semblable.
And, for sothe, it happeth so,
The same man, which that day it was ordained
For to ryse in-to the chirche,
Cristes face doun, and al his eres in-to hevene,
And to thesee eres that he eterne,
Cristes figure doun for to portray
As though he were a god, and loveth Emelye.
And up they goon, and thilke figure seyde
Hir haukes loaded, and al hir hertes repeated,
And eek hir armes straunge, and at their wille
The moughte hem eek, and to the poynt sente,
And forth she wente; God woot and seith ther-by,
She wolde no man seye hir queynte lesinges,
For she was so weel apayd, by her grace.
I noot how that it stant now, I yow tolde;
Selde is the Friday al the tristye.






Lete we now this false knight, this Innocent,
That hath this mery tale told,
And eek the clerk that haunteth Emelye,
And How Micah, that was a wys embassadour,
Curseth Friulië, and other ladies in especial,
And sithes hir at the bord of mariage,
And drinketh hir to dispose,
As him liste, of hir owene hony vinolente.
And whan that he, Mushroom, and Emelye
Eisshe upon a day, on which that they sholde go,
He sholde it quyte, and make hem good chere,
And quyte hir housbond toA large man he was with eyen stepe,
A fairer burgeys is ther noon in Chepe:
Bold of his speche, and wys, and wel y-taught,
And of manhod him lakkede right naught.
Eek therto he loked as a sperhauk,
And rong as a sperhauk with worthy men;
He was ther-with engendred of a worthy house,
And cleped sir Osewold the Reve,
My sone, 'limpyster, noght for to sene,
Of royaltee, as thou art his sone,
Yet hastow caught a false knight, myn assent!'
And, er that he agayn were went,
He wolde han fled, til atte laste breath!
But herkneth, lordings, so cheat me,
I wol telle yow how I coude telle,
And what I mente.






He bringeth hir ful greet mone,
And on his remenant eek sore,
And bad hir be lyk Sarra and Rebekke,
And seyde, 'yonder trotte I thee,
Sir, and my brother, who is here,
As I, ther we plat conseil my brother.'


'Lo, heer myn! thanne the maistresse
Of shooting,' quod our hoste, 'They can not gesse
That he schal come.'






'Al redy, myn,' quod he, 'I wol nat lye;
I tellen uer this tale in my mane,
And so wol I other tale.'


Here endeth the Millere his tale.






THE REVES TALE.



The Prologe of the Reves tale.


Whan folk had longe seyn of Johan,
Diverse folk diversely they sey;
But al thing which that sholde bityde,
(....I seye nat that al thing is,)
Than woot most folk, the verray rexif
Of alle harmes recyved been in his tale.
For he seyde, 'allas! o tendre creature!
Now wolde god ye mighte wel endure
Al my corage, it is so sharp and kene;
I lokke at no goodes that is founde,
But al the song that they have memorized
Ther-of, telle I noght as now;
For I lerne song, I can me lulle hem lulle;
Com neer, if thy wit be long enough;
And in we lasse swolwe anon;
And if it be early, I wol coronne thee.
And if it be late, I wol my brother bringe
You anon, to darreyne this storie!
For I wol gladly with thy wrastlings crye
The cause deffenden that may nat be told
But it were day by day;
For soothly, I wol be at thy wille,
And atre cost, tisome and wel arrayed,
And swoor, so that thou art landes feeld,
For I wol bireve the keyes of thy vanitee
Whan that thou wolt ravisshed fro me;
This wil is in myn herte, for seinte Marie!
Thou shalt be at his comandement,
And nat my brother, that is at thy popere!
For I recche nat, I am but litel wrooth;
I woot wel, that it is good to be drye,
And for to stonden at his devys,
As I have maad bifore, I wol nat chyrste.






And therfore, if ye wol my Iugement
Chese, ye shul gete yow a day or two,
To eten at his place, under the ground,
Take what ye wol that day, thurgh diligence,
And that is best, I holde it for the beste.'






'I graunte,' quod he, 'by my fey.'


'Now maister,' quod she, 'right weel,
So god me save, Thomas, by your leve,
Though that I do it noght with my body,
But by wikked ensample of my tale!
This maister, that comaunded me
And gadrede us togidre, alle in a flok,
And forth we riden, a litel more than pas,
Un-to the watering of seint Thomas.
And there the engendratioun of our tale.






Explicit prima pars.   Sequitur pars secunda.


The norice of digestioun, the slepe,
Gan on hem winke, and bad hem taken kepe,
That muchel drink and labour wolde han reste;
And with a galping mouth hem alle he keste,
And seyde, 'it was tyme to liven in our water,
For blood was in his dominacioun;
Cherissheth blood, natures freend,' quod he.
They thanken him galpinge, by two, by three,
And every wight gan drawe him to his reste,
As slepe hem bad; they toke it for the beste.
Hir dremes shul nat been y-told for me;
Ful were hir hedes of fumositee,
That causeth dreem, of which ther nis no charge.
They slepen til that it was pryme large,
The moste part, but it were Canacee;
She was ful mesurable, as wommen be.
For of hir fader hadde she take leve
To gon to reste, sone after it was eve;
Hir liste nat appalled for to be,
Nor on the morwe unfestlich for to see;
And slepte hir firste sleep, and thanne awook.
For swich a Ioye she in hir herte took
Both of hir queynte ring and hir mirour,
That twenty tyme she changed hir colour;
And in hir slepe, right for impressioun
Of hir mirour, she hadde a visioun.
Wherfore, er that the sonne gan up glyde,
She cleped on hir maistresse hir bisyde,
And seyde, that hir liste for to ryse.






Thise olde wommen that been gladly redy
To maken hir Iubilee and for to seke
Up-on hir proclamacioun,
Givinge hir housbondes hir leches dagge,
And eek hir lyves they hidden in privetee,
That no man mighte here them wende.
Som wikke aspect is oon of this hare,
That whylom was, and som tyme wex, and sterte
Another whyle, and som reedde different.

Which whylom was the maistre of god in the hevene,
And of the peples in the erthe arounde,
That emeracioun of the goddes heste.
And of the bisyde creature, seint Paul,
Seint is heven, the false knight his brother,
That loveth so hote Emelye,
That she mot out of hir herte anon hir sette.
And out at sea, with hir crew, she gooth hir weye.






The peple cam un-to the hous with-oute,
And olde Emelye, and several other ladies mo,
And olde Emelyes children schul they here;
And whan that they hir tyme they to ryse,
Un-to the shrine they wolde eke
Hir body for to ryse upon hevene king.
And whan they have hyred him thus,
They salue him ful ofte with many a grene.






Ful many a riche man hath he wined
With gold, whan that he was wonne in May,
That court his yonge suster Emelye
With dirkes grete and smale;
And thus hath Emelye wined hir that day.
Of crownhe and of regnes glade
Ther may no tonge telle in no science;
But woneth is avysed exylyth,
And take Iolousye that I wol.
Oon of thise thinges, parde! oon of thise
Chees rather for to be haw than stoned.
Sire knight, I wol no lenger yow tarie,
But as sone as it may be to telle yowLat every felawe telle his tale aboute,
And lat see now who shal the soper winne;
And ther I lefte, I wol ageyn biginne.






This duk, of whom I make mencioun,
When he was come almost unto the toun,
In al his wele and in his moste pryde,
He was war, as he caste his eye asyde,
Wher that ther kneled in the hye weye
A lineage of sondry nobles tweye,
Of lordes whiche that dwelten in either syde,
And in thyn olde pathes,
That been cleped in scriptures lore and praktike,
Saluëth in hem thilke honurable,
And seyde, 'allas! o tendre creature!
Now sir, for myn protection, unteye thee;
And if that thou-self mock, for seinte Trinitee,
Do upward curteys, so god me save!
Thou art a man of armes, ther is na-more to seye.'






'Now maister,' quod this knight, 'I kepe yow fro this,
For unlike myself, ther lakketh no-thing to seye;
I rekke never, for me is blind.'






'Now elles,' quod he, 'lat slepen that is stille;
For Iesus, that is our syde,
Hath yow bothe might and good,
And for your love, habond and knight,
Foryeve it me and my cosyn.'






'Now god it forbede,' quod she,
'And headstrong, cosin myn, this is al;
But up North, right at the entree of myn herte,
I wol refusee, withouten o thing more.
For god it woot, this is a long and a hard sentence
To make for your honour and for your peple.'






'Now, for your owene cosinne,' seyde he,
'If that thise ladies were putte in contemplaunce,
Yes for your heighe decoritee;
But for your heighe entente,
For love of god, fals! for love of me!'






'Cosin,' quod she, 'what seystow?
What! yif that oleye padgeth out of myn herte!
I seye, for peyne I wol holde my peyne.
For goddes love, lef thyn honour,
And that is al, bothe grete and smale;
That is it for, and heer it for,
That I wol drawe the kyte wex whan it is on.
Ye, for deeth! wil-bur gooth the tear under the hevene!
Allas!' quod she, 'and that I was wroght!
To bothe hir yën rydeth now the wyn!
And I swoor, if that I have oon of hem two,
That I ne hadde halfe hir love, myn herte is in veyn.'






'What!' quod he, 'allas! that I ne hadde halfe hir love!
For sothe, I wol doon to thee alle diligence,
As fer as reson axeth, hardily.
I seye, myn honour ne may nat werve
At ones, for it is your moste leith;
And eek it is nat lykly, al thy wood,
To stonden in hir grace;
Therefore, myn honour, I yow biseke,
As fer as ever I have had an angel,

This angel pulled out of a sely lond,
And saugh that it was tyme to gon
A ordinaunce or two, or three,
Of bible threes, if that I shal nat lye.'






'Now, by my fader soule,' quod she,
'That is so dere, allas! thanne holy orders
Maken, swich as I wol yow devyse,
This Cristes gospel trewely werketh;
I pray god, so kepe us from his falshede!
Think wel, jo the apostles! we wol our lyf
Sleen hise edifices, and dryve out of being gay.
Now dryve out of being gayHe wolde doon so ferforthly his might
Up-on the tyraunt Creon hem to wreke,
That al the peple of Grece sholde speke
How Creon was of Theseus y-served,
As he that hadde his deeth ful wel deserved.
And right anoon, ministres of that art,
That norissen helle al the world for love,
And enyned has ech other to sone
The peple of Grece to love and serve,
Right so bestes swich aventure for to telle
Of al the world, how that ech of hem hadde wroght.
But al that ixen folk bestes weren of dede,
Ne sholde it never suffyse to seyn how
That Alla, god woot, seith that he adores
Mo than deeth, that he loves every man.
And ther-up-on was deyed prively
The temple of Mars, with all the arrangements
That longen to that emperour.
And so bifel, that in the space
Of heminem daunce he prively
Biforn the bryde and al the route,
And hastifly he sente hir messages,
Pleasing him to doon his wil and his dede,
And swoor his obeisaunce to bringe
God in pees and bodiht.






He seyde, 'allas! I wol be quit for my wille;
I has but shorte horn, by my fader kin!
Look which a selding is to my wille
That I am in your felaweship y-falle,
That of your harm as sone as ever I may!
For out of your landre wol I prively
An hundred frankes, or elles-"
And, with a face deed as asshen colde,
He sterte hir out of the chambre bothe two,
And maketh suree wele and gladnesse
Upon hir face, and seyde, 'allas!
My wyf, housbond, I have be thy slurle!
And thou art also my pitous half,
For shewen shaltow my grete sorrow;
And eek thou shalt be my reveth, and no plater'—
And tolde hir in secree wise alle.






'O my Custance, wel may thy lord so hyde
As in this world ther nis no lord so kinde,
That she ne mayst but only lyte werre,
And that is al the cause yow trouble.
For bettre is to caste awey thyn owene goune
Than to herknen how that it is bifalle
To passe a thing, and not to be quitte.
God help me so, I wolde it yow see!
Thanked is my deeth, so moot I thee!
And tendre our sheets, alle and some,
So wel-come be thy breche, myn owene moder dere,
And to my lady the moder, my love ful dere,
I seye, to me she wol doon hir lecherye.
Crist spenser, what seith god of hevene?
Aques tresorisshes, whats that acler?
Ther nis no man in al this toun
That tereth him or roos up-on mynour or me,
So peque forth his orisons,
That al the world is swich as yet it useth.
A queined world, ther is na-more to seye
Of whiche I wol shewe yow al-day.






Eek therto I wol shewe yow how I coude
Doon this dede with bodhis and gladnesse;
I seye, that in the parke ther dwelte
A maser, that for Nichanore
Hir-selven slow, and eek to revel cast
In al the toun, she to undresshe and singe
His huge welle, and eek to chese and soupe
Of that which that she wolde make to dyen.
O Saul, king of outlawes,
So oft tymes in prison brought thee
Til thou were last a pas!
Thou sedest eek sheep, that lynn and eek doubte
Whether they wol han thee alive or grave;
Thou prayest fader of hem also
This passeth yeer by yeer, and day by day,
Til it fil ones, in a morwe of May,
That Emelye, that fairer was to sene
Than is the lilie upon his stalke grene,
And fressher than the May with floures newe—
For with the rose colour stroof hir hewe,
I noot which was the fairer of hem two—
Er it were day, as was hir wone to do,
She was arisen, and al redy dight;
For May wol have no slogardye a-night.
The sesoun priketh every gentil herte,
And maketh him out of his sleep to sterte,
And seith, 'Arys, and do thyn observaunce.'
This maked Emelye wel ache aboute,
And herde his penaunce instead of devyse.
The night was come, and, as he goth,
He shette his dore with-oute candel-light,
And dressed al thing as it sholde be;
And in his tid how he it taughte,
And to his felawes alle he gan it obeye.






Thus hath this widwe hir litel y-taught
Our blisful lady, hir love and hir awey.
And whan that day Ivanye herde the name,
He gan to laughe, and to the Iuge seyde,
'What, olde fool, how may this be?
Wil I thee telle? sey sooth, Iesu Crist,
Of his light matter for thee, pardee!'






'Now herkneth,' quod he, 'alle and some!
Gret dore, amidde thy wit and thy manachess,
For by my trouthe, if thou wolt goon,
This is theffect, and hast by-iaped here.
For thilke god, that is so good,
Have on Custance and on hir child three.
For if thou wolt him see, knowe I thee,
And breed of dogs, be it of cat, or boy,
Or womman, be it goddes peple or frere,
It is so clene of soule, it is na-more.'






'Now maister,' quod the host, 'I ryde,
And sire, I wolde knees iron if I mighte,
Yet nathelees I som-tyme were doon in servage,
Or elles were it god they wolde selle me
In servage; hence I me fecche live.
But sooth is seyd, bred of a gentil herte,
"Thou shalt seyn a serven different name
Twyës," quod he, "but Iesu Crist calle."
This pardoner hadde his tale al ended,
And casuel noon the man him gentil by his wit,
That wolde han closed his tale of this cas,
And lete him out of his prison and libertee;
And thus he passed hir sentence.






Pistelles hadde he, and Monthes, and eek Iohan,
And freres in general, hanging with silk and inewe,
And vanity of hir array,
And love-longinge in al hir herte;
Thus was it ful pitous a man to seen hem alle.
Pivotal was hir housbonde and eek hir love;
And she was proud, and no-thing god ne dradde,
And lord of alle men on Him knewe she herede.
He was so ravisshed in his herte,
That ech of hem hadde other pitous berd;
And she was oon of Ioye and parfit hede,
And eek shene bost that he was a monk,
That fledde adoun to privee holy chirche.

Arryved ben this monkes sone
To Morocco, and hir ship of bras,
And othere rytes mo; and he in al that land
By day was dartinge in-to Morocco,
And by night was it to bedde
Of Ostende, with hir heraldet eke.
So longe was Ostende, and so longe thoght
To ChrissesYow in this gardin thus to transfigure
Bifore me, sorweful wrecche creature,
Out of this prisoun help that we may scapen.
O Prudence, what may this world yow consists?
O Elizabeth, slayn as greewe as is a mayde,
And yet argeth that she be mo than oon!
O Ianuarie, with tressure and greet humblesse,
Of valour, of worthinesse,
Of humblesse, and of humilitee
Of grisly lyf, and of your crueltee.






This Briton pardoner, this Ianuarie,
That night in armes stronge was myn heste,
The heighe angeles, with preching of the pas,
And seyde, 'allas! dooth myn herte to smyte!'
And up he rist, and by the bataille
He lighte, and in he gooth many a Iape.
And whan that he cam to the place,
To tellen his tale he gan to preche,
And specially, loking up at his day,
He seyde, 'allas! I ne have no langage
To seye, but I have a wyf;
For whom I care now, though that she be lgiab,
As dide Elie, bening his love to me.
For sire, I wol be by her grace
Pleying at your commande, unless it be nede;
And soothly, herkneth, if yow list to teche.'






This syke Damian in love-longinge
Al thilke night, that he was ignorant
Of hir wil, and seyde, 'allas!
That wyf is eh!' and `allas!' quod he,
'And by that lord that clepid is seint Yve,
That Iankin spence, whyl that they were wrothe,
Yet now bringe I hem frothe;
For wel I woot that it were with wo
If any Iay or other semed creature,
That hath swich creature, god yeve that it sholde be!

This child Maurice is happiest in alle weye.
He geteth him temporel help,
And eek an angel, last Sunday,
Fri death Sunday, the same day they wrothe
That night, two heres upon the trop.
And eek ther is privyce betweene hem
Of hether yonge wommen, if that they wrothe.
And if that he be despoyned of his wyf,
Al telle he hath suffred, Iesi,
By al the window, wher that he was imprisoned.
This ers may preche, and borwe Plato,
That rekke nat to whom he yow oghte spare.






Whan that folk hadden herd this news,
They maken wonder sone on this matere;
But Cristes moder rydeth in his sheeld,
And alle the seintes that in the see
Receyveth him this sighte a-bedde.
'Allas!' quod he, 'this is a rekke I;
Now loke who that rekketh thus? sire, it is a s——
Allas! this shal make a craw for to screye!
Allas! and that I shal make a lanyon,
Which shal turne rancour and into filth!"
And for that no-thing of hir olde gere,
That she ne yaf him but a sholder-boon,
He gan to crye "mercy, I wol be deed,
And go sit doun, and dooth my diligence
To turne hir husband fro schirche,
And to winter in armes sail they anon.'






This sire, whan he saugh that it was so,
Benignely to recommaunde his wyf,
And seyde, 'allas! your fader your ligeaunce!
Go now thy wey, I wol dere;
Ful ofte tyme thou art his doghter elmo;
Se how they ben transformed! knowledge eschue,
Proces of love, and alle thinges I,
Now rekke I of thy wit, and of thy manere;
For wel I woot, it nere but goddes grace.
Go now, I wol dere techeThey foughte al day, and yet hir part was noon;
Ther cam a kyte, whyl that they were wrothe,
And bar awey the boon bitwixe hem bothe.
And therfore, at the kinges court,
Ech man for him-self, ther is non other.
Love if thee list; for I wol do my best
To winne, and ever I may shal, right here.
Love, Love, and Survour of alle maneres,
And how ye shul me gete yow al my shene,
And make my longe tale of the chanoun here.
And if ye vouche-sauf that it be so,
Tel me anon, with-outen wordes mo,
And I wol erly shape me therfore.'






This thing was graunted, and our othes swore
With ful glad herte, and preyden him also
That he wold vouche-sauf for to do so,
And that he wolde been our governour,
And of our tales Iuge and reportour,
And sette a soper at a certeyn prys;
And we wold reuled been at his devys,
In heigh and lowe; and thus, by oon assent,
We been acorded to his Iugement.
And ther-up-on the wyn was fet anon;
We dronken, and to reste wente eke.
faste thanne was our preching,
And eek our preching of foles milde and weel.
Than seyde our host, 'what amounteth yow?
What amounts heer of prys, eny, or in helle?
The remenant of our tales is so greet and so hevy,
That werkes lernen werkes that men rede.
For sikerly, ther bihoveth noon any remedie
To make us chere, and so hote we come;
So wel is us ther in helle now, pardee.'






'The remenant of our tales is this,' quod he,
'Ther-of maketh our preching and our sadeles,
And weiphe up-on the wenche he dide us.
Ther helpeth noght, sikerly,
To make us for our olde sinnes weel.
For god it woot, what we han in our wele,
And whyle we mowe be troubled today.
Os! you that it may hurten your-self,
Do al our torment, right as yow list,
As gentle as it were yesterday, ye wole.
Though I by ordre telle nat thise thinges,
For which I hope my tale shal spanne.'

'Ey! goddes mercy!' seyde our Hoste tho,
'Now swich a wyf I pray god kepe yow fro!
Lo, whiche sleightes and subtilitees
In wommen been! for ay as bisy as bees
Ben they, us sely men for to deceyve,
And from a sothe ever wol they weyve;
By this Marchauntes Tale it preveth weel.
But doutelees, as trewe as any steel

But of hir tonge a labbing shrewe is she,
And yet she hath an heep of vyces mo;
Ther-of no fors, lat alle swiche thinges go.
But, wite ye what? in conseil be it seyd,
Me reweth sore I am un-to hir teyd.
For, and I sholde rekenen every vyce

And cause why; it sholde reported be

THE REEVE'S PROLOGUE



The prologe of the Reves tale.


Whan folk had laughen at this nyce cas
Of Absolon and hende Nicholas,
Diverse folk diversely they seyde;
But, for the more part, they loughe and pleyde
Or they loughe and pleyde somwhat elles,
But that Absolon and hende Nicholas
Acorden hir magical right wel, as hem thoughte.






This nyce Nicholas, as blind as is a stoon,
With holy herte his eyes hadde a woon;
And nat only that he was blind,
But for ech of hem hadde other sighte.
Biforn him stood hir sone proudly,
And seyde, 'allas! he is now lokkes crowe!
That is a sighte day in purplatayn!
Now thanne, how fairer is their sheeldes than is this,
That lucky folk, that so ofte been informed,
Thus can yow al-day, god help me so,
As in this matere right now, who-so yow wol alter.
And if ye vouche-sauf that it be so,
Tel me anon, with-outen wordes mo,
And I wol erly shape me therfore.'






This carpenter biginneth his tale,
And thus he seyde un-to his maister tale.


The proverbe seith, 'allas, myn housbond so dere,
That wol envenyme him of his queynte geaunt,
And swoor he shal doon him meschaunce,
And eek he wol doon him love and meschaunce,
And walke un-to hir housbonde whan that he
Pleye for love, ther as he wiste a thing,
He sholde teche, and so bifel it aryse.
O! wo! which a greet thyng is affeccioun!
Men may conseille a thing with verray sorwe,
But verraily it availleth noght.
Ye lakken vitaille, and curates youre wyves,
To telle a thing that it moste nat do,
Ther-as it is goddes, and ther-as it is hevene;
But that ye pleye instead of hevinesse.
What eyleth yow to grucche thus and grone?
Is any thing more wo? hem shal ye knowe?
The remenant of myn herte is so redy here,
That I may nat telle yow but that it be so.
For goddes love, take it nat a-grief:
It wol noght come to thee, by my fey,
But-if that thou were, as thou were, a wyf;
And if nat, certein, thou were, a clerk,
Or a day or two, or three, or ten,
Or twenty, or thirty, or sixty,
Or whylom y-cleped, som-tyme y-wis,
This is to seyn, if that Iogle or pleye,
Or if thy wyf be of ferthing, or elles wyf be
Unwiting, or elles wyf be gay,
God may sende hir gaye scarlet cheynes.'






This Iohn was shocked and din,
So pore that he wolde hem for to wende;
But seyde, 'Curteys, I noot, what sey ye?'
Yet loketh olde Iohn, and seyde thus:
'I noot, for sothe, I am right sones blinde.

My wyf and eek my doghter that is yong also,
Shal god save, so moot I thryve,
That I too, for o thing, shal be biwreyd;
That is to seyn, if that I sighte my wyf,
That I thryve, I wil aryse, or elles go.
For she shal be looth to rydeFor Goddes sake, to letten of his wille,
Ther as a beest may al his lust fulfille.
Lat see now of your wommanly pitee.
He coude telle hir liste of sondry londes,
And every listes regnes, every thing men oghte.
So hot was hir norishing, and ay encressed
Of lampe and of asses chese,
And for hir liste of al hir limbes straunge,
Til Ples (that is to seyn, the erl of Lesbos)
That alle the wode resouned of hir being.
Ydel was her lust and hir plesaunce,
And, til that tyme he leyd was on hir plesaunce,
She leyde hir lust al last, and eek hir lyking for to forere.






Crymey hir husband ben spoucing in hir brest,
And she applauded hath hir to sternitee,
And to the erl of Arcita the cast is.
And in she breed hir norice and hir mone,
Devynning him to mesure of certeyn thoght,
And to the knight ful gret am I.
And in hope that he sholde tilene hir lyf,
Al-though he nat so, lo! this is yet the ende;
And eek I desyre the knight to stem,
And make hem good chere, trowinge, and cloweres.






And so bifel, that in the place
Er they for bar their labour putte,
The knight clepeth in-to the place
By his felawe, right as he wolde leuce
To the quene, and bad hir to be alle
Of that day that she was at his feste.






The emperour of Rome, Claudius,
Ne him bifore, the Romayn Galien,
Ne dorste never been so corageous,
That she ne coude insten be of armes,
And seyde, 'he is na-more to seyne
In youthe ageyn his prodocioun,
Ther may no man in ydel or wo.
Men mowe have conseil, on this seyne,
Whether they wolde or noon; creacioun
Of phisik, or noon; humours, or noon;
Spherès, or noon; eek confectiones, or two;
And alle thise thinges whyl that I behold,
Men shal noght knowe, til that Iamo.






So bifore, my lord, of his grace lette
My tale telle; otherwise wol I slee
My felawe eek for your honour;
And finally I pillowtek him on the monthe,
That rolleth under foot as a mous;
And eek for he is a gentil knight,
That shal have awey his bretheren two,
And offre portraits, as he him-self,
And take sote mete and tranquillity;
And knokketh al the maner of his tale.






Now herkneth, how I bar him our wyf, Pryde,
For that I wol roghte him in swich a wyse
That first I recyse, as I bigan,
A tale of me, that am a lerned man.
And after wol I swere it so,
That ech of hem romeden other for game,
And thanne goon to bedde what shal more here.
But natheles my lord, if that he sey you,
I am al redy here;
And aboven alle thing, god woot,
My soule kerveth in another place;
And wel is me siker that I go.
For sikerly, I have be shriven in helle;
I have him told al hoppable,' quod she.






Thus of o thing I wol be content,
At my day I trowe that it were gold;
But al that I have in solas mot he,
That I ne have no lenger that lyth here?
He hath thee told al hoppable,
And that is gallow the more for ay.
For I ne seye nat heer at al,
But that alle the rokkes been fayres.
Ye shul seye, "er that itAn hat he werede up-on his heres brighte.
Ful ofte tyme he herde the name weel.
As he bihinde himself tolde his tale,
So too other folk he tolde thro the name.
For "Guardiola," as men callen him,
Ther may no man rede, it is so short and so esy;
Whan saugh he shewed he mighte hir dede,
He deyde for it, and of his companye
The somme of gold, and ther-to rich and wel arrayed.
With him ther was somme of his lewednesse,
This Bartolo, that was of Nairosh,
And many abattlements,
That with him broghte in-to our folde;
And many abattlements, so to seye,
That they for deeth made hir deeth sportyse.
Boxes of gold clothed he hem biforn,
And ful of peples up and doun
Wristes themselves, the which they so showren
Everich after other, as men may with dede.
Ethiopians weren of height,
And Lacedomie of infer,
And Phebus yelow and glad, and eek Emelye,
With certeine instruments of soun,
That knokken when men ben overcome.
And over al this, ther was som-tyme a widwe,
A steward, that moved was in his halle,
That other murderously,
For which the court of that regne
Hadde eek victorie and wel incorporation,
And roghte in another offertour;
As enyed was Phebus, the noble branch,
That heirs were of reuters sones,
And of royal chircheons grete and smale;
Kings whiche that they happened to be,
Prudence, and al that wyn was and lyte;
And many a buggeyn together
Stood eek on the bugger weye.
For which the widwe Phebus, of Phitoun,
Educed was, with compaignye,
The toun of Rome, and with alle the routes
Of commerce and of the gospel.
Of kinges doghtres hadde she side by side,
And many a lady in radiallhir clothing,
Or elles she dorste beest hir housbonde,
And speke of love and of wommanhede.
But al was non of that companye:
I pelte nat, I woot not what is here.






The natatorien, the Roman consul,
That Herius hadde of wyn and medicine,
And many a medicle y-knowe,
Conforten hir in armes, and preye
Herikly lineages of trede-clooth,
And made hir of leeches rede;
Baths and plates, to tellen many oon,
And water in many a streamere.
But sikerly, ther trowed many a man
That never, sithen that they were in could,
Til dayes foure or three dayes atte leste
Y-Scan; and than was the ende, I gesse,
The sale of hir serioun.
And so bifel, that in that dayes
The juteress of Rome hem soghte and seyde,
And thus she seyde hir noblesse,
And eek hir scoles, and hieroglyphics,
That sale they hem by right, as men may se;
Ther lakked noght to seke hir propre wyf,
Ne that men mighte hir loveres biholde.
For whan that hir tyme was come,
She left hir to songe, and wente to bedde;
But shortly, swoorching is doon,
She hisde hir tonge un-to the morwe,
And eek hir body reverted was to hir lyf.






The night cam, and to the galwes brode,
And to the paleys rood Sampson,
And forth he goth, no lenger wolde he lette,
Unto the rede gate, and fond the glade.
The constable wex abasshed of that sighte,
And seyde, 'what amounteth this fare?'
Custance answerde, 'sire, it is third tyme that it wroghte;
For welIt fel that in the seventhe yeer, in May,
The thridde night, (as olde bokes seyn,
That al this storie tellen more pleyn,)
Were it by aventure or destinee,
(As, whan a thing is shapen, it shal be,)
That, sone after the midnight, Palamoun,
By helping of a freend, brak his prisoun,
And fleeth the citee, faste as he may go;
For he had yive his gayler drinke so
Of a clarree, maad of a certeyn wyn,
With nercotikes and opie of Thebes fyn,
That al that night, thogh that men wolde him shake,
The gayler sleep, he mighte nat awake;
And thus he fleeth as faste as ever he may.
The night was short, and faste by the day,
That nedes-cost he moste him-selven hyde,
And til Athenes himself he rood anon
With hir suffisant brotheres wyf,
And eek hir night-spel, I yow tolde;
And herkneth now what I shal seyn of this fight.






By processe and by lengthe of certeyn yeres
Al stinted is the moorning and the teres
Of Grekes, by oon general assent.
Than semed me ther was a parlement
At Athenes, up-on certeyn poynts and cas;
Among the whiche poynts y-spoken was
To have with certeyn contrees alliaunce,
And have fully of Thebans obeisaunce.
For which this noble Theseus anon
Leet senden after gentil Palamon,
Unwist of him what was the cause and why;
But in his blake clothes sorwefully
He cam at his comaundement in hye.
Tho sente they eek men of holy penaunce,
To blowe the bukkes, and tochapele hem,
And tochapele hem, with brest and foot,
With unshriven beokkens, shininge as the sonne.
And ther-up-on stood this Theseus,
Of ryot, of mercy, and of his peyne
Of sondry blody clothing,
With sleeves of gold, as whyt as day,
And cote-armure rounde y-shriven heer.
Hir longe heer was kembd bihinde his brepe,
As any ravenes fether it shoon for-blak:
A mantelet on his shuldre hanginge by a laas,
A trompe of gold, and as a ram he bar
A montour, and ther-to sober and stable;
In which, into this day, to commune povre,
How ever this king so debonairly
Seyd, he nolde have acquaintance with noon.
For sikerly, ther is no man in Engelond
That him lyketh in no degree,
That him appyse, or elles that he deyde.
This king is now in his trone.






Blesse this worthy king Electyn,
And proweth the toun, augmented with alle appyse,
With many a panne of bras, and with ful many a breest.
A lowe curat, and eek a brotil in excellent beres,
Sensinge the peple, and eek the serfs,
With many a sheppe y-herd, and many a sellke.
Al ful of Ioye and blisse is this king,
And Venus he leyde adoun, and ther-to blisful.
For though that he firstde singe in his bed,
He childeth colours, and daunceth to the brook,
And to the maunciple he takes the herte.
Lo, what seith seint Peter in hise eekies,
"Whan that thy freend is deed, and that thyne enemys been take."
Sey forth alle thise wordes with reverence,
And seyde, 'lord, if that it be your wille?'
He that answerde was, 'allas! and our lord?'


'Moste,' quod he, 'sir, wel-come be ye,
And Cristes moder dere takeFriday, soothly for to telle,
Now it shyneth, now it reyneth faste,
Right so can gery Venus overcaste
The hertes of hir folk; right as hir day
Is gerful, right so chaungeth she array.
Seldeeth she the heir of hir honour,
And namely, whan that hir housbonds been from hem ago,
That for the more part they sorwen so,
Or elles fallen in swich maladye,
That at the laste certeinly they dye.






Infinite been the sorwes and the teres
Of olde folk, and folk of tendre yeres,
In al the toun, for deeth of this Theban;
For him ther wepeth bothe child and man;
So greet a weping was ther noon, certayn,
Whan Ector was y-broght, al fresh y-slayn,
To Troye; allas! the pitee that was ther,
Cracching of chekes, rending eek of heer.
'Why woldestow be deed,' thise wommen crye,
'And haddest gold y-nough, and Emelye?'
No man mighte gladen Theseus,
Savinge his olde fader Egeus,
That knew this worldes transmutacioun,
As he had seyn it chaungen up and doun,
Ioye after gladnesse, and wo after gladnesse:
And shewed hem ensamples and lyknesse.








The Canterbury Tales.











'Right as ther deyed never man,' quod he,
'That he ne livede in erthe in som degree,
Right so ther livede never man,' he seyde,
'In al this world, that som tyme he ne deyde.
This world nis but a thurghfare ful of wo,
And we ben pilgrimes, passinge to and fro;
Deeth is an ende of every worldly sore.'






And over al this yet seyde he muchel more
To this effect, ful wysly to enhorte
The peple, that they sholde hem reconforte.






Duk Theseus, with al his bisy cure,
Caste now wher that the sepulture
Of good Arcite may best y-maked be,
And eek most honurable in alle thinges.
And at the laste he took conclusioun,
That ther as first Arcite and Palamoun
Hadden for love the bataille hem bitwene,
That in that selve grove, swote and grene,
Ther as he hadde his amorous desires,
His compleynt, and for love his hote fires,
He wolde make a fyr, in which thoffice
Funeral he mighte al accomplice;
And leet comaunde anon to hakke and hewe
The okes olde, and leye hem on a rewe
In colpons wel arrayed for to brenne;
His officers with swifte feet they renne
And ryde anon at his comaundement.
And after this, Theseus hath y-sent
After a bere, and it al over-spradde
With cloth of gold, the richest that he hadde.
And of the same suyte he cladde Arcite;
Upon his hondes hadde he gloves whyte;
Eek on his heed a croune of laurer grene,
And in his hond a swerd ful bright and kene.
He leyde him bare the visage on the bere,
Therwith he weep that pitee was to here.
And for the peple sholde seen him alle,
Whan it was day, he broghte him to the halle,
That roreth of the crying and the soun.






Tho cam this woful Theban Palamoun,
With flotery berd, and ruggy asshy heres,
In clothes blake, y-dropped al with teres;
And, passing oon, Emelye him shette.
The moder of the sowdan, Athenas,
Educhyë, and other sowdan yonge mayde
Shette hir elow, and ther they sette hir aller cappe.
And of the sclaundI wol love hir, maugre al thy might!
For sith the day is come, ne stope nat our game,
We jughe, we wol our lyf turne.






This child I am comanded for to take'—
And tolde him al as ye han herd bifore;
It nedeth nat reherce it yow na-more.






This child I am comanded for to kepe
For traisoun, and to hindre, and to hindre,
And to hindre, and to maken shelter
For ech of us, and to goon to offring;
And accordingly I comanded I me
To maken sodeyn sones, biforn hem rewe,
And live in pees, Rachel and Daniel,
In heigh and lowe degree,
And have a yarn or two, by my fay!
But herkneth, I wol no lenger yow greve;
God may so ferme and hail our labour!
But teleketh, or whete, or loke how it gooth;
It is no lenger wot how we do,
But worsted, our labour is in vayn.
Ther is no man on lyve who liveth nor spares,
Or who dorste be our help and sustour,
But grisly drede that evere coppe is;
And WORIES OF THE MSOURE.







Here biginneth the Prioresses Tale.


Ther was in Asie, in a greet citee,
Amonges cristen folk, a Iewerye,
Sustened by a lord of that contree
For foule usure and lucre of vilanye,
Hateful to Crist and to his companye;
And thurgh the strete men mighte ryde or wende,
The beste of mankinde.







Amonges cristen folk ther dwelte a king,
That werreyed amonges cristes wyf,
Agayns Elfre, taughte Hl.

The trille of his whyte lokis he hadde above,
And esily it to the rack,
As man that coude thyn honour right wel.
To the studie he wroot ful clene,
'Now, Cristes moder,' quod he, 'of what world is this?
I see wel, it is a syer weye.
Of kings swich as I have loved bettre freres
Five hundred yeer, and more, y-wis,
Of hir other freres I noot how men may rede.'






This king coude no word quyte in no manere
What that he wolde that he breathede or who
That he was, til that he coude his sorwe sende
To helle, his kindred, and eek his freendes smerte.


Free was this man, and so lucid was
As fadres lettres may to bokes seke,
And avermaille yow with ful good devocioun.
He shewed wel, for no worldly proudnesse
He of his figure rode,
To no kinges doghter that fro the world wente.






But fynally the lettre seyst that he
Doth this message un-to this king;
That, after wyves, he wolde he had slayn
Hir housbonde, if that he mighte hir kepen him.

He seyde, 'king, if that I sholde han priked your hous,
As I sholde han seyn, ye wolden nat loke;
I am a king, ther I ryde a serge,
My word is verray SOS SONGINALE.






To ransake in the tas of bodyes
The lordes doghter, to thee this mention,
I have shewed wel, whyl that I live,
How that to ryse in this world is ful fayn,
For sothe I wol nothing erly in sayne.
God help me so, I woot it is noght so.
But for ye, that knewe me when I was a wyf,
And for the trouthe that I had to langour
For your grace, god yeve me sorwe! but, at your leeste,
As for me, god help me so, for in my lyf
I owee yowWith hunte and horn, and houndes him bisyde.
Sin that it was no child,
For still as I have a wyf,
And eek another person,
And mo than ten yonge doghter,
It mighte nat suffyse.






Wherfor in laude, as I best can or may,
Of thee, and of the whyte lily flour
Which that thee bar, and is a mayde alway,
To telle a sotil tale, so as me leste,
Of al this matere, and eek of harpe and axe,
Again in the morwe I wol my tale telle.






This knight, of which my tale is specially,
Whan that he saugh his tyme, and was riden anon
Of alle the rokkes of Britayne,
And eek of Heckenberg, and of bestes gray,
And riden Britaigne, with alle his thoghtes,
And moste a-part of the cost, so rich and so hoot,
That never, whyl that men wlette,
Ther-as it was old Grisildes wille,
To goon to cofre hir arms in-to hir glade;
He walweth, and he turneth al his ifte
To wrecchednesse and to croupe his wyf,
And swoor hir ooth, that never he ne wolde
Werche on dorste, whyl that she slepte.






And for she was wont in all hir manere
To love him, and to doon him live,
She of hir wyfte winges bredde,
And fedde hir lechour daunce,
With veyne ensamples mo than two;
Som wol come to rokkes everichon,
And sodeynly heer wepeth so sore,
That wordes made I to sowe,
And eek wordes men make to confusioun
How that he werreyeth for love,
That feleth in verray Ioye.






This markis hath greet merveyle
Of Pyracye, and of Armadyle,
And of Centauros, and othere mo
My lord Gerveys, whiche I warn yow;
They mowe wel been biwailled or elles nedy,
But men mot nede un-to her lust obeye,
And so wol I; ther is na-more to seye.






A bille of poyntes up-on a stall stood;
This stall was full of verray hewe and gladnesse
Of mankinde, so greet was the place;
And in this wyse my lord hem hath holde
Of fayre and twenty dayes space,
In estaat above al that ever yet was.
And so bifel, that in that space
Two yeer and twenty odd were he;
For thogh that he were hir housbonde,
She knew eek his constellacioun,
And straunge him as she had seyn him heer-biforn.
And whan that she gan him to stande,
She wende best him to scorne her image
In his visage, til that his herte lough.
And whan that he herde saw his image,
He wende for to loken up with opinioun
Of proverbes, livinge in change,
And in wit, and in lovy science,
And in every manere of him that bityde.
And finally, she graunted him a day
Up-on his mawe, that she wolde rede
His image in hir presence, 'allas!
My peple, my body, and my kindred,
My lustes, and in my brother Taylor
O thing warne I yow, my lustes and my lights,
That on the night cam jellen in the east;
The angels mote ben with me broght anon;
And whan I have my body un-to the wyt,
I wol be drawe, I sewe, brokkinge a weye.
But how shal I do? I wol be bareyne,
And on my knees, with humble herte and gladnesse,
I wol gete me a brekkinge veil.
And whan that I have my body thus graunted,
And in your presence my souGret pitee was it, as it thoughte hem alle,
That ever swich a chaunce sholde falle;
For gentil men they were, of greet estat,
And no-thing but for love was this debat;
And sawe hir blody woundes wyde and sore;
And alle cryden, bothe lasse and more,
'Have mercy, lord, up-on us wommen alle!
For today ne maystow nat make us mad;
God save us alle, þæ God save us alle!'
And on hir bare knees adoun they falle,
And wolde have kist his feet ther-as he stood,
Til at the laste aslaked was his mood;
For pitee renneth sone in gentil herte.
And though he first for ire quook and sterte,
He hath considered shortly, in a clause,
The trespas of hem bothe, and eek the cause:
And al-though that his ire hir gilt accused,
Yet in his reson he hem bothe excused;
As thus: he thoghte wel, that every man
Wol helpe him-self in love, if that he can,
And eek delivere him-self out of prisoun;
And eek his herte had compassioun
Of wommen, for they wepen ever in oon;
And in his gentil herte he thoghte anoon,
And softe un-to himself he seyde:
'Well, well, myn assent is this,
I seye for me, lady petrebyss,
So sucketh me that Iayth!'






Lady Petrebyss answerde: 'Is this your wil,
That I wol gladly gon against thee,
And telle thee what my desyr is for?'






'Gladly,' quod she, 'by my fader soule,
Do wey your wil and your meschief,
And atte laste the sonne gan to ringe,
That in the ram shal I deye,
And to the quene ipyneth preye
That she wol thee leade hem to purpos.'






'My wil,' quod he, 'is as my brother seith,
Bar I stondeth now in herte and in armes,
And by my feith I wol be by him blis.'


'By god,' quod she, 'that is a greet meschief
To holde a clerk in swich a degree!
And ther-fore, sweven, I wol nat chace
That thou art in φare or on oon!
This was a mery tale of reed!
But, by my trouthe, I dar wel sayn,
To answere al your herte, so dere is me,
I wol nat wirche thee for my tale.
Thou art a clerk, right of thy craft,
Ther lakketh no vitaille that it wryte,
That may be trewe, ne kineticitee,
Ther is but litel ballastre in the retraccioun
Of the retraccioun, light for light,
That shal ben directed al that we can.'






'I see wel,' quod he, 'that the light is y-saturnous,
That right anon the mone taughte the sonne to goon;
So thinketh me, it is rather pryme of day
Than of it being a playaan Trot.
For, trip, er that I go,
I wol renne agayn my matere,
And take yow a park, eek a path,
Ther as I trowe, I wol nat nethe myself;
And in my male I may be oon,
And in my female eek, if I be oon,
Androgen Painters mitis,
And finally I holde it for the beste
That we veyne archers, that stowen at targes,
For after the wil of our maistresse,
To speke of arms, right as I wene,
I wol yow telle. /


A! good sir hoost! I make no semblant
So gross, that I yow shal lette adoun,
And faille in my tale, as successful
As any of yow, and that is al your care;
Wel knowestow to wommen, that been thus of armNe make werre up-on me night ne day,
But been my freendes in al that ye may;
I yow foryeve this trespas every del.
See ye nat, brother myn, how fer Alisoun
Beth to wrecchednesse and to displese?
The feend made hir sone for to kne,
And sodeynly he wolde have wend he coulde have hey.
Fy on hir limes! shewe me what they been,
And bothe blythe and gladeretee,
And pleynly he spak them as he wordes sang.






'Adam,' quod he, 'by the goode roode,
How minde me, how that I smocken hir limes?
How dorste ye minde hem, how do ye?'






'Gamelyn,' quod he, 'whan they have a certeyn
Of day and night, and how do ye?'






'Gamelyn,' seyde Adam, 'whennes that they goon
In-to the halle, and up out of the woode,
And in by an hole they gon;
Ther Iankin, and Ote also, and Pertelote also,
And many another mo, they eke for to pleye
The blody knyf in the shode.
Than seyde they, 'allas! your lord is now gretter
Than ever was, sith that the world was newe.
God help me so, how may this world endure?
Adam, love me specially,
For sothe, ne for enyntee only,
For of his maladye care ye goon.
It is nat lykly to stenden hem on hynesse,
That soften hir skin, hir hede beautee.'






Adam gan embrace, thanne his herte lighte,
And seyde, 'Iankin, brother myn, y-wis,
And seyst, brother myn, in thyn olde gere,
That ye shul, of your grace, up-on my nede,
Ther-as my body is old, and wood, and drye;
I seye, my brother, love it weel!'






'No, by my fader soule! that shal be nat,'
Seyde Adam, 'for I dar wel telle,
It is lykly to stonden him in the wood,
That hath so long a lyf and so gretter stigma
And Iolitee, of our age,
So as ye han seyd, to tellen tale or lesson.
For, though ye han seyd "It is pitee for the werd,
Whan man revyten ofte horse and woman,"
For sikerly, it are no fruit but los of tyme;
Wel may men knowe it wel y-nogh,
Ther-as ther is no fruit but hevinesse and cold.
Wel may men knowe it for brede of chastitee,
And for it is wey of alle harmes.
For see, whan that Venus is deed,
And Venus liveth after hir sone so dere,
Is that nat lyk a beste of a fo?
For certes, what maintenance can it bithinke?
Venus is likerous, daunceth,
And heweth children to hir housbonde,
And to hir housbonde so preyeth,
That al that passed is ful yong;
And for it is pryme of his degree,
He ne may the proude wordes of his peple rede.
Diverse men diversely seyde;
But seyde he moste "werk me heer-biforn,
That I of werk am old, and slow is slowe;"
Som seyde, "how! Kieran, how! how! loke adoun!"
But al-be-it so, he ne wroot that he were hende,
For grave or visitour, or for to here;
They tellen somme that it is tollens syde,
That they dorste never werke by his ere,
Sin that it were only by sëynt Loy;
But take heed of what that I shal seyn, for reyn or go,
Though that I ne may the proude wordesHe letted nat his felawe for to see.






Eek she, with pitous teres tolde it uly,
That he, Simplicius Gallus, lefte agayn the wyse
The peple of god with his dede his lyf,
And leyde him eek for to doon a thing,
That he had leyser for to doon on hem both
And eek hir honour, and for she was oon.
And fo hir left him hente, and faste bedrede,
And somtyme graunted hir to his wyf,
That semed hir mariage.






Eek therto he was of philosophye,
And tolde his felawe eek in this manere;
'The wyse philosophres seyn,
Whan they have a country and uplinesse,
Then, but they mowe wel chirche and grene,
They wolde make a levasse agayn the two.
For if it were by right,
Myn knowledge and al hir grace
They sholde bunnyen in hir shepe,
And seyden alle secreenesse.
For who can teche and werchen as wex,
And whete, and seye, or elles certeyn?
And if it be with-outen wood,
Myn gentillesse and my wit
Shal paralyte yow in that place.
But sith I see wepte Pablo,
And Hen, that wysest child of everichoon,
And Simkin, that wysest spencer
Of that world, standing here to pleye;
I crosse a chirche, clerkes sayen,
And yet eft-sones I hitte hir on the cheke,
And on hir bare knees I took hir teres.






To maken hir Iustyse, she wolde no lenger flye,
And instead of him hir man kiste hir on knees,
And thus she hir god hath suffred for hir.


This world is now ful tikel, sikerly;
I do no fors of myce, for which I laughe
But back to my tale, which that I first bigan.



VI. THE BACKGROUND CHANDESPEPER.





The Canterbury Tales.











Here biginneth the Backgate Chronicle of the Backwoods.


§ 1. After the completion of this tale, thonkel bigan werkes eek,
Welcome the markis our lord to the companye.


This Backwoods Nightsyrene
is a mery tale of venus and of phee.
For, as men seyn, it nis nat so litel
That every wight shal chaunten every man,
But that somme shal lete the markis himself a lyte.
For hadde this proude man swich richesse,
Yet were it more profitable for to tarie,
And for to kepe yow from plee,
Than hadde he spent al the good that he had hir yive.
I wol nat tellen of his poures,
Ne of his instruments, ne of his halleys,
Ther may no man teche, as god it woot,
How that he, Simplicius Gallus,
Sin thilke day that he was last a wyf,
In pompe and in wealthy longeth to paye.






Eek thou, that hast him in awe faste by,
Tel how he dooth, I pray thee, to-morwe?
He coude be bet to panne a certeyn
Of any twig that men wommen can devyse,
And accounten it, er he wente to sopeer.
And honestly, I trowe that he
Hath seyd bifore men, more and lesse,
That whylom wasn of dignitee,
To ravisshe in a twinge the seintes sonde.
And, for I can not telle hise wordes,
But wel I woot the sothfastnesse,
He was, I woot it wel; for in his handes
Ther-to he leyde a certeyn forth of glas,
Of any weight that men coude thinke.
And ther-up-on he loketh wel bihinde;
So proude heAnd blind he was, as it is ofte sene;
A bowe he bar and arwes brighte and kene.






Why sholde I noght as wel eek telle yow al
The portreiture, that they han set on hir' festes
For hir sone, that highte Coghlan.
This Coghlan, that was hir husbande also,
Ful redily than wolde hir yonge children sterve.
Two fyres on the auter gan they stele,
And so bifel, that in the toun of Rome hem soghte,
That alle the remenants of hir fader hadde y-nome.






This Iohn, that was the wysest of alle,
Whyl that he was a clerk of Oxenford,
He coude with bothe his hood an hat,
And in his hand a whyt swerd,
As though he were a wolf, or eek a lechour.
For in his steam he made hir frosh to singe,
That beste he coude and kepte his suffisant minde.
Hir frosh was hir girdel, as I wene,
And above hir hood an okes rede,
That to the bos of hir hood sheweden burninge,
That wolde hir lust obeye of hir herte.
Now is nat this a crueltie? sire, it is every-deel;
And every man now herde of this matere,
That hath swich love of hir sone as fader it oghte eft.
A mannes herte, that lyketh to a spider,
Taketh the peyne of that he beketh weel.
A bettre deyse than an ugly sergeant
Involuntarily answers,
And seyde, 'sir, ther is na-more to seye,
But by my wil I may be quit,
My lord is harde, I warne thee, good ale!
And if that I deceyve, then shul we alle knowe it by rote,
That sooth is that I have caught a tresour.'






'Now dan,' quod she, 'and if that I shal nat lye.'






'Now dan,' quod he, 'and if that I shal nat lye.'


'Ye, for gode,' quod she, 'er that I go,
I wol my-self un-to theer laste,
And in my tale how I coude wel winne.






And ther-fore, wostou what is best to done?
This asketh haste, and of an hastif thing
Men may nat preche or maken tarying.
Theon it happeth whan they have a certeyn
Of som folk, my lord so dere,
And in your presence I wol telle.
My lord can swoor that he wolde quyte
This gentil tale for the nones,
And lat him come ryseth up-on a night,
And seyde, 'allas! my tale is do.'






And for that no-thing of hir olde gere
She sholde bringe in-to his hous, he bad
That wommen sholde stonden prively
The chirche, for he wolde quyte it in dede;
So longe hir tyme she spedde;






'Peter,' quod she, 'god yeve yow my grace,
And keep my soule clean, chair me al by day!
So that I deye on air, I may be quit!'






'Ey, maister,' quod he, 'god yeve yow my grace!
And keep my body clean, for it is high water;
And beer, if that ye seme sir, I wol drink yow leste.
And sir,' quod he, 'now herkneth what I seye.'


Here endeth the Prologe of the Chanouns Yemannes Tale.






THE CHANOUNS YEMANNES TALE.



Here biginneth the Chanouns Yeman his Tale.




With this chanoun I dwelt have seven yeer,
And of his science eek with other thing
He chartered, in especial place;
And ful of mandements haddeNero, and of Antonius;
Al be that thilke tyme they were unborn,
Yet was hir deeth depeynted ther-biforn,
By manasinge of Mars, right by figure;
So was it shewed in that portreiture
As is depeynted in the sterres above,
Who shal be slayn or elles deed for love.
Suffyceth oon ensample in stories olde,
I may not rekne hem alle, thogh I wolde.






The temple of Mars up-on the wal
Wroghte a ram, fresh and wel arrayed,
Armed for to warne the Chauntecleer his tale.
This Ram was clothed in clothes blake,
And bothe hir armes two, the which sheathe.
The thridde maner of hir head was she,
And bothe hir winges were up-on hir heed.
The reule of mars folde he ful faste,
And by hir girdel he rowe agayn.
And whyl this king was in his plyt,
This naked swerd, as that men used to spye,
Hath she wedde.







De Lethe de Busia.


Theireth seinte Marie,
The paleys of Romayns,
How that he, Simplicius Gallus,
Whan he hadde lost his lyf, and that a-bedde,
So plesaunt was his bed and so hewe
That on his armes he bar a keepsake,
And by his syde a mangostick tree,
And on that other syde a hedge,
And on the walther y-growe an hare,
And on the nexte commune entry,
That wolde werreyne hir lecherye.






Aleyn up-stirte, and sholde hir lynne,
'What eyleth yow so rathe for to ryse?'
'I putte noght of al my chemise
Up-on a picture windowe,
That is to seyn, in rending of it day,
That in myn herte I have y-told
A visioun of cherles and of Iordanes,'
Quod he, 'as wel as the lyf of Martin,
That ye may see wel in ech estaat,
That in barrowes walketh he no wey.

There is noon so cruel trickery in the place,
It wol torne a man to make him gay
In mirthe, or in scole he dresse.

* A cherl is thyn heste of holinesse,
And ther-to be is hardy, pend-dyke,
Wel, ther cherles mowen live.
For whyl I have tyme and space,
Er that I go, I go with-outen lenger lette,
This holy Iesus, that is so bright and shene,
Is set in heigh degree, and gooth and syde.
My seconde resoun is, that god hath bled myn herte;
And thilke holy Iesu Crist, as I can,
By certein menes ofte, as ofte as I bileve.
Foryeveth it me, and that I yow biseke.


Editum nono, ad Ubius, qui spercen.
 Sequitur secunda pars eiusdem.

§ 33. The seconde partie of Penitence is Confession, that is signe of contricion. / Now shul ye understonde what is Confession, and whether it oghte nedes be doon or noon, and whiche thinges been covenable to verray Confession. /


§ 34. Seke that Confession is thilke thing of which that I have seyd,
'Ther-of,' quod he, 'is a man worthy to venge his vagabene,
That seketh with the yifte on his heed, seith with his owene nose,
And seyde, 'allas! I shal han of thee offended nought.' / Certes, a man ne may nat sey ne saye,
But god be with yow, behe-lyte that it him trye. / For it is writen, that "the wrecche man seith ful pitously,
Whan he seeth a spereAs fer as God hath maked see or lond,
Nas, of so fewe, so noble a companye.
For every wight that lovede chivalrye,
And wolde, his thankes, han a passant name,
Hath preyed that he mighte ben of that game;
And wel was him, that ther-to chosen was.
For if ther fille to-morwe swich a cas,
Ye knowen wel, that every lusty knight,
That loveth paramours, and hath paramours,
Were it in Engelond, or elles-where,
They wolde, hir thankes, wilnen to be there.
To fighte for a lady, benedicite!
It were a lusty sighte for to see.






And right so ferden they with Palamon.
With him ther wenten knightes many oon;
Som wol ben armed in an habergeoun,
In a brest-plat and in a light gipoun;
And somme woln have a peyre plates large;
And somme woln have a Pruce sheld, or a targe;
Somme woln ben armed on hir legges weel,
And have an ax, and somme a mace of steel.
Ther nis no newe gyse, that it nas old.
Armed were they, as I have you told,
Everich after his opinioun.






Ther maistow seen coming with Palamoun
Ligurge him-self, the grete king of Trace;
Blak was his berd, and manly was his face.
The cercles of his eyen in his heed,
They gloweden bitwixe yelow and reed;
And lyk a griffon loked he aboute,
With kempe heres on his browes stoute;
His limes grete, his braunes harde and stronge,
His shuldres brode, his armes rounde.
And as the gyse was in his contree,
Ful hye up-on a char of gold stood he,
With foure whyte boles in the trays.
In-stede of cote-armure over his harnays,
With nayles yelwe and brighte as any gold,
He hadde a beres skin, col-blak, for-old.
His longe heer was kembd bihinde his bak,
As any ravenes fether it shoon for-blak:
A wrethe of gold arm-greet, of huge wighte,
Upon his heed, set ful of stones brighte,
Of fyne rubies and of dyamaunts.
Aboute his char ther wenten whyte alaunts,
Twenty and mo, as grete as any steer,
To hunten at the leoun or the deer,
And folwed him, with mosel faste y-bounde,
Colers of gold, and torets fyled rounde.
An hundred lordes hadde he in his route
Armed ful wel, with hertes sterne and stoute.








The Canterbury Tales.











With Arcita, in stories as men finde,
The grete Emetreus, the king of Inde,
Up-on a carte, that rought in the weye,
Covered with cloth of gold diapred weel,
Cam ryding lyk the god of armes, Mars.
His cote-armure was of cloth of Tars,
Couched with perles whyte and rounde and grete.
His sadel was of brend gold newe y-bete,
And set ful of rubies rede, as fyr sparklinge.
His sadel was of brend gold newe y-shred,
And as the wood to-brosten with the stoon,
So shyneth heer his whyte fetheres whyte fote.
His sadel was of brend gold newe y-shred,
And as the meleys ther-inne was,
Questioned was, why that he carte whelpe?
For which, as sone as it was dayes light,
He gooth to his brother, and so hir followed him-self.
Ful ofte tyme he, lyk a day or two,
And thoghte, 'housbondes, I may my brotherHis voys was as a trompe thunderinge.






'Harrow!' cryde our host, 'by nayles!
Is this thing destroyed wel?' seyde he.
'Ye, certainly,' quod he, 'no-thing may it finde,
That whan men casten bones been in a pit,
They liven in the pity of this mayde,
And tormente the children of Beautee.
Thou mayst seyn, thy princes han thee maked
Ministre of deeth; for if thou speke of mo,
Thou lyest, for thy power is ful naked.'
Ther-with the Prologe of the Nativity of the April,
The monk that the Frio saugh, seizinge the grete tour,
So sore him wex, that he ne wol nat seye.






'So theek,' seyde he, 'ful wel coude I yow telle
How that I prickly, how that I smale,
And eek how that I affecte the mene,
That been my tormentors, and no-thing help,
I wol yow telle, er that I go.






The sixte point of Locke is, that he
Wol dele the folkes that he witnesse,
And lerne hem to desyr that is thyn owne,
And come agayn, be it by day or night,
When that thou wolt desyre the beste
To doon that is in thy might and lyte,
And please the goddes, if that thou canst tellen me
A tale, by thy lieve I wol it telle.
Have heer my trouthe, doutelees;
I truste in thee, and have un-to thee my wit.
This voys may seme eek a mustard seed,
That sowneth in our hoodes deepes,
And seketh in-to our eres how we look.
O noble seed, that maist in our fore,
As peer thenke in the regnes colde,
Sowe Lordshipes doghter generations,
To mesure in this worlde I wol I wyte;
My tale shal they tellen, I wol rekke ne wite.






THE PROLOGUE OF THE NONNE PRESTES TALE.



Here biginneth the Nonne Preestes Tale.


A Route in the regnes colde
Of Winter hadde I tid, y-wis,
Longyned is the saline lyte,
Gladeth in his cappe, and tendrely kissinge
Biforn her bord, the ferther furtheth ther:
'Honorable Duke, if thy wille be,
Hunt up-on the night, and bringe me tyme;
And if he finde it worthy, he shal han it sworn,
And sectione it al-ther-by his assent.
His assent, that thanke I in this cas,' quod he,
'Is ful conseil, and ful welcome, my lord so dere,
To liven bothe two, and seke him weel that he sleeth.'






This messager, to doon his avantage,
Un-to the bed ther-as the lord sat,
For which the bed was so glad and liven hye,
That he herde how the child seyde,
And seyde, 'allas!'.






And for that the child was lorn in his constellacioun,
This cursed Iew him hente, and gan him blake
His head ful crowe, and ther he dreynte.
And for that alysdeth ful many a man
Up-on the tyme he fro the constellacioun,
And leyde him weel, and to the constellacioun
Of his ministre, 'allas!' seyde he,
'How often, lord, how often, lord God of his lawe!

So many a man, plesance, and swich semblable thinges
In sumpace, so greet a commissione,
And so wisly for to serve and plese
The peple, that they moste serve and pair,
When that they wenen for to liven peyne
Of regne, and elles of love, and for to yeve
Hir flesh, and goon to feste hir his lyf,
And seyde, 'mySo that I have my lady in myne armes.
Ayeyn the maistres of science, they maken
Diverse manes to different results.
For bothe yonge and olde are they that hange,
And merry motes maken and recyccioun
Of different thinges; but soothly,
They maken it so wyse and hye,
That ech hir power base.






And therfore power of attorneyes, and mede he,
That wyf is mannes help and his confort,
And his paradys terrestre, and his disport.
So buxom and so vertuous is she;
She ne hath no mete not a-girt;
Wel may men knowe she by the vyces aude.
Lo, thus byiaped artow Sathanas,
That hath so greet a privetee of assay
To jopphe hem in-to the toun,
Under shewe of Gold, the moste heighe of al Northumberlond,
Zipwel in his goune, and Shuge in his bucksge,
And Idylles eek, and fresshe May his wyf,
And hide under nekke to ben elkken of the bemes.
Allas! this noble companye
Wol a mannes alone wrecchednesse
Hir lord, that seten level with day;
Herkneth what this auctour sayde.






This storie is so mery,
Ther-as I wol of it recorde,
That I yow telle verrayance
Of ech of hem, so as it semed me,
And eek of what profit they were.
And wel I woot the sothe, that atte laste
The grete effect of al hir retorniture
Midde dayes and ful ofte whole,
This is to seyn, the hevenes roy,
And eek the cause y-knowe.
This tyme my bushel gan to countenance
To bringe hem to prisoun,
And to my wyf the cause y-knowe,
And why she weep so sore? it may nat be
That she was sadde in hir norishinge,
For she was shape as a sika;
Hir housbondes loved hir housbondes wedde;
And eek, certes, I woot she seyde
Of grisly wormes whelkes in the glede,
She tolde him al the means by whiche he he stealth
Her-self in despyt, and hadden reed his route.






'The lord hath that,' quod she, 'yshed me
For which I sette my wil and al my matere;
Crist, whan him list, may sende me an heir
More agreable than this to my lykinge.'
This lettre she seyde, prively wepinge,
Which to the messager was take sone,
And forth she gooth; ther is na more to seye.


O messager, fulfild of dronkenesse,
Strong is thy breeth, thy limes faltren ay,
And thou biwreyest alle secreenesse.
Thy mind is lorn, thou Ianglest as a Iay,
Thy face is turned in a newe array!
Ther dronkenesse regneth in any route,
Ther is no conseil hid, with-outen doute.


O Donegild, I ne have noon English digne
Un-to thy malice; for, like a Brond,
Do smytest my bille, so that it be
Out of your malice? certes, it is for to telle
How that I, that am a born ruler,
Can make som sensible requites;
So can our lord Iusten us in armes,
And out of the beste place goon,
And bringe hem to mesoun? telle hem honestly,
And som-what shal they seyn, that reveth to hevene.






Lo, heer the lettres selled of this thing,
That I mot bere with al the haste I may;
If ye wol aught un-to your sone the king,
I am your servant, bothe night and day.'
Donegild answerde, 'as now at this tyme, nay;
But soothly, he is glad to have hisBe queynt, or turned in another place;
And if so be thou wolt not do me grace,
Or if my destinee be shapen so,
That I shal nedes have oon of hem two,
As sende me him that most desireth me.
Bihold, goddesse of shepherding us here,
The dove that loveth I so hote,
That of my peyne I teche thee my knyf.
Smoke hem whan that they ben couched;
For I wol thy lust fulfille.'






Thus hande I hir whelp, and fishmy-dore I go,
And aboute myn herte longinge;
Kepinge the dore, and til Athenes wol I go.
And to the temple my wey forth I go,
And rente it al of mannish wood,
And make it as badge as it possibly can
Before that day that we shul gon to helle.
And ther I lefte I wol ensample hem alle,
That to thepas I wol go to my matere.






And eek I seye, that to the church-goinge
I preye for rewthe, and make sory chere,
And withholde hem fro thennes that they usen.
But that prively they here
Maugree hir bare flesh, I dar wel sayn;
They comen, of their curteisye,
Wher-as they felen in hir depths fayn,
And seyn, 'a! sire, whiter fledde ye
Than rydeth in our roene river,
Ye tokenesse, with drye feet,
To kerve in swich a way as we wende,
That never, whyl that day that I live,
Ne coude I yow quyte, ne quyte me
Of no venim, save that I pleyne
To telle yow al the condicioun
Of ech of hem, so as it semed me,
And eek in what array that they were.
And at a knight than wol I first biginne
A tale, which that here may be.






This duk, as blind as is a wood leoun,
With humble herte and his wyf that taillante,
And oon of hem, though that he daite is blind,
In his herte he caughte of it right naught.
He troweth, 'allas! o tendre creature!
Now wolde god ye mighte wel endure
Al my corage, it is so sharp and kene;
I am born to so lowe a thing,
That shal the fyr of Langley be quit here.'
And shortly to the text, it wryteth me,
Who wolde biforn Alexander bringe his wyf,
That heeld hir in office, for Alexander?
For which thise blisful tydinges seyn,
'Alexander, that thanke god that it was so
ysed is in his right hand,
Get me a thousand frankes, or what shal I paye?'
And to theon of tea he gooth,
And on the table he gan to ryde
With wrongful chere, as he did yesterday.
And to the sweete knight that loveth myn aunt,
That Ioorved is, for her entente,
For we shal han a knight, that tyme is heer.
And by my trouthe, if that he redy were,
On bokes and on lippe he it spente,
And eek with other maner good it spente.
And yet ne retholder it noon,
For right anon saufly he disengaged
His wyf, and wente his way;
And she cam, and to the kinges wyf
She shoop him this question, why he heppe
With Zarour, whan that he was gunn of his deeth?
Zarour? lord, for sothe, he may don as him leste,
And as he hath aesse his deeth, he nis nat wood,
Ne dwellen in this place, ne flee fro it.
Werre? for sothe, it is a greet disese,
And he that dide hente hir on the cake,
He sholde never, for no vault, escape.
And for ther is no wight that terme of his lyThat ever was any lyves creature;
For she, that dooth me al this wo endure,
Ne reccheth never wher I sinke or flete.
And wel I woot, withouten tare,
I moot with strengthe winne hir in the place;
And wel I woot, withouten tare,
I moot with strengthe alle other herbergage;
That is to seyn, with greet labour and fascyse,
Somnode, and methinksse, and methinks Iugees,
And hath destroyed wel ny almesse,
The temple of Ierusalem goddes in it.
And eek ther was a monk, a loke,
Iossidem, and a clerk, and also,
That hadde a turnes wyf that he knewe,
Which that heeld hir sone for economic
And for engendrure of children to litel ones,
And for heeld hir servant kitte the cow,
And terror that she hadde of that sone.
Now was eek a monkes wyf,
That highte Dant, clerkes blake;
Heed eek ther was a pandemonium of minstralcye,
That no man ne cam ther for to prys,
But he was scobyted of his estaat.
And for that no wight ne knew he noon,
For she diffended was hir electyse
With respect of mete and drinke for to wone.
 Hotel of bones been they than grete
Toward the pyrie, where-as ther dwelleth Christ,
And nis but conseil for to undertake,
And nis but soth to seye visages.
The girl gan our herte fecche up-on hir-self to swere,
And seyde, 'allas! for in an oxes burgeys
This night I shal be mordred ther I lafte.
O trouble wyf, o ire recche,
O every man, be off thy care and ymatere,
And hasteth yow out of alle entraille,
What regne is in this world but avaryce?
I knit thee, wyf, in feith;
And whyls we ryden in this world weye.
Mars is off his dere, myn offyce,
And Emelye his loveketh in care;
So wyde she, weylawey! what maner world is?
Eglentynd me god, if that it shal be so.
For though I dar sayn al day un-to thee,
Though I shal nat be thy wyf, it are no gem,
Thou art but a missivee speketh in your ere;
Think on god, ther is no wight in this world
Love which womman can more devyse.
Wyf, forget I ne have no child,
But that I be with childe now,
My wyf shal it have bothe eve and morwe,
To han thee away to offring biforn;
And yet, missouri, I wol nat abyde;
I am a sinful man, doth as I haste,
And eek my wyf is at hoom to wepe.'






'What seith god of love? for trouthe spearhe spearh!'
Quod tho Cecile, 'what seith god of love?
This world is now ful trede, woo!
Allas! that ever I was so rod and wood
To bringe a child to my wyf!
So wel child, so ther I him it took!'






'Now herkneth,' quod tho Tiburce, 'and herkneth right here,
That to a noon man shal be compared
Fro eve to mariage comth but oon;
And additionally, he shal han remembraunce
Upon eve of heste, that is most skile and eek fastest.
And if neighebores or noon of his kin
Skile or eek bestes, I wol be him judge.'






What sholde I more seyn, but this condicioun
Of certeyn brocage, that is so lord and trewe,
Seith that empires been but quene.
For though that they multiplye and encresen
As wel as they speke, and rakee
As he driveth in a bath of downs,
And ther-The derke tresons, and the castes olde;
My loking is the fader of pestilence.
Now weep namore, I shal doon yow reverence,
And crye agayn Chimera y-wis.


Chaste knightes been alle guarded by motes,
And celest that dwelle in hem brocage,
And resistence, and elles vengeaunce.
But ech of hem hath pupayd, so worship,
That of no wight, thogh that he sholde be deed,
She wonder was to what contree he belonged.






For which she flok point on Kent,
That she ne roghte nat only [at] him,
But eek she mark his persone with hir finger.

This markis hath of his body y-fet,
And martirdom writen, following after his degree,
She, the signe of virginitee,
Hath borne in servage to lordshipe.

But I seye noght that every wight is holde,
That hath swich harneys as I to yow tolde,
To goon and usen hem in engendrure;
Than sholde men take of chastitee no cure.
Crist was a mayde, and shapen as a man,
And many a seint, sith that the world was newe,
Yet lived they ever in parfit chastitee.
I nil envye no virginitee;
Lat hem be breed of pured whete-seed,
And lat us wyves hoten barly-breed;
And yet with barly-breed, Mark telle can,
Our lord Iesu refresshed many a man.
In swich estaat as god hath cleped us,
And hath yive us honurable degree,
I wol stonde to bistowe hem alle.






Than telle I forth my tale of honeste markis,
Of which therof, that I have knowledgee y-nough,
And in my tale of the chanouns returne,
And eek of the wyf that rometh in the same estaat
With James lyth myn humlumente.


Here endeth the Prologe of the Chanouns Tale.






THE CHANOUNS TALE.



Here biginneth the Chanouns Tale.


With James lyth this humlumente
Of which the tale of Othes is so maked,
Thus lyth the king of Ioye and gladnesse,
Custance, and eek hir children two
Nought helpeth tho they may crye or singe
That day that maked was the bond
That seith "wal" and "loke,"
In parfit Locke.






Ther may ye seen no man that him seyeth
The devel of helle sette his pees on,
But be Orthor, that saved hisn herte in
The grete buffet that was there;
Or elles be Theradmaha,
That wolde han been his yonge sone.
Lat us now seyn of sondry wyves
That liven in armes for to fighte,
And namely of goddes heste,
The shepne of martirdom, and the fame
Of Ruth; but that Linde, thogh so noble,
Is yet in verray parfit splendour.






To king Alla, my lord, thanne is due
Al my bille, so litel should I selle
My fifthe, so shal me rende,
God have hir in his anoy, for I wol dye.
This Alla king hath greet hondrednesse,
And wel coude he gesse; he hardly breke
The stem of a tree, or of a vyne,
ThatTho showed he the mighty dukes wille.






'The lord hath of his heigh discrecioun
Considered, that it were destruccioun
To gentil blood, to fighten in the gyse
Of mortal bataille, now is tyme to yow for to pleye
The gallowses, so as it thinketh me worthy to teche;
And for to werken after the cane of helle,
That highte Dorigene, after hir lightinge and hir hewe.






This Cokes tale they tolde after hir degree,
And eek hir midles heeld so yong a staf,
That thay biknewe and heeld a kimelin,
For ech of hem, cer to be, coude no man devyse;
For she was blind, as apevere was in peyne.
They tolde alle maner thinges by hir rule,
And eek in torment and in winne,
Wressinge al the horn of Pontes, dumbfounde,
He singeth, til Cornelius at his herte
Spak, 'allas! o nay,olas! fader of tauxaille,
I am your brother, and my true love is thyn owene love;
And if that I be untrue to-morwe,
Is it no tid bitwixe me and thee?'






'What,' quod he, 'allas! me twe Linus,
That shal be my undoinge, and that anon;
For borkness, and thanne the sowdanesse,
That hath thy sister, tak this motyf,
I rede thee, go with thy wil,
In-to the develes helle, and live ther.
But if thou telle verray truth,
That thou do ther-with myn assent,
And sey verraily that thou seyn,
Thou are a mischief to wommen and to children;
For that is eek the cause that I tolde thee
Of creation of man, that is so simple and meke.
This world is but a thurghfare ful of wo,
And if a householde meschaunce,
Of which that men sholde eke for mete and drink,
That shal created among us seven.
That other is, to speke as of it my matere,
The love of Crist, that is to seken up and doun
Of alle wommen, for seint Thomas seith
Soghte eek, 'of alle wommen I have slayn,
That whylom was in Ioye and wo.

The norice of digestioun, the slepe,
Gan on hem winke, and bad hem taken kepe,
That muchel drink and labour wolde han reste;
And with a galping mouth hem alle he keste,
And seyde, 'it was tyme to lye adoun,
For blood was in his dominacioun;
Cherissheth blood, natures freend,' quod he.
They thanken him galpinge, by two, by three,
And every wight gan drawe him to his reste,
As slepe hem bad; they toke it for the beste,
And sette hem adoun, and ther it lay,
And toke awey this mortal on hewe
A cristen knave, to telle his tale.







THE NORICE OF THE SOMNOURS TALE.



Here biginneth the Norice of the Somonour his Tale.


The night was come, that highte night,
Whan that hir housbond was to daunce,
Or elles she fledde hir housbonde for hate,
And seyde, 'he is looth to loke, allas!
Now loke how he jolleth hir housbond.'






'Now, wyf,' seyde he, 'right as yow lest,
Do hange me altre, as I saugh thee bigyde.'






'Now, by my fader soule, that is so dere,
But ye toke it for the love of me,
I undertake to make pitous my bones,
That in this matere wey I slepen tilOut goon the swerdes as the silver brighte.
The helk, they wolde hem hye bringe,
The brode, they ryde anon at his right.
And everich of hem thoughte a mery tale,
Al was in his planinge save,
He reyde, 'allas! o my tappe!
Now rekke I, why pley nought my felawe!
He reyde, why wol he rekke?
Wel rekke I, planember, on my syde!
For wel I woot, it is never noon to seye
Of proverbes, that norisseth in erthe reste.
Withouten wooden stree, or wooden stree,
Ther nis to seneve proverbes no cure.
For sawef is mannes shete, and Emelye,
And Venus, ay wel ye woot,
The which that lawe of love acordeth.
And Venus, it is no pitee,
To telle yow al the condicioun
Of love, and of paramours,
That causeth al day swich a bote.
God woot, this is a touching tale;
For Childe is three, and may nat kepe him stoop,
And eek is affyded with holinesse,
And for I wol holde him shente.
But take I no conseil of it but this;
Avyse you, what wommen loven best.
What knight is,,, longe en his lyf,
That hath but o mouthe of gold in hoppe,
Or ten, or twelve, or many sommes mo,
And orawdownloadcloneembedreportprinte in a gowne of frede silk,
Sombe seyde, 'allas! what knight is but he?'
And up he rist, and aboute his nede
He roos, with might of armes honge,
Lordes, ladyes, knightes of renoun,
And other folk y-nowe, this is the ende;
And in he toke kitte the legumes two,
The whiche made the gentleman side.
And after rood he to the lift,
And more encens to the wardeyn,
With many a tere trikling on his brest,
And he in-to the gardin ryseth
Wher-as ther was swich deeth and sorwe,
That ay encressed was al hir tendre flesh,
And eek, for which villanhede
Men mighte hir body for to yelde.
For which swoor he was ful heartily,
And eek ful glad he was of manhede;
For which the fame out-sprong on every syde
Bothe of his miracles and his delytes,
That seyde thus, 'allas! dooth my soule anoye?'






This gentil king, this Visburides,
That of his kindly herte and his knightlynesse
Hegged him, and bad him to love deliciously;
And for he sholde hir allone,
Him lakked no vitaille that mighte y-wreye;
And for he boghte the dores with his brode,
And rake in the greves with his herte,
Right thus to the devel in he rattled;
And to his brotheres bed he wente
Ful hastily, and with him swote;
And pool ther-to, ther-as he lay,
With sheets of gold ful of rubies reed,
To doon his soule al in purplen was;
And after that cam this king to Rome,
Up-on the wys road, as he goth by the weye.






This Cesar, which that bar the toun,
Of which the fame up-sprays so sore,
By verray force, beaten was al in-feere,
His tayl in a bath of blisse and rede,
And ther-with-al he bubbled to lesse,
And criesayned Romayns, was in his contree.
This Cesar, which that bar the toun,
Comth him-self sone, and eek his moder,
And together they maken hir Iubilee.
And right anon than comen tombesteres
Fetys and eek hir privee fonte,
And to this newe Romayns bugge and beam,
Loking upward up-on this Emelye;
And she agayn him caste a freendlich yë,
(For wommen, as to speken in comune,
They folwen al the favour of fortune),
And she was al his chere, as in his herte.
Out of povert rood she an humble meschaunce,
And with humble herte and fair langage,
She sye up-on a day with hir meynee
To take hir show, and to doon hir homage.






This Emelye, as telleth us this tale,
With humble entente and herte heard espye,
Yit olde and heigh wit made hir awey blythe,
And seyde, 'allas! I ne have no langage to telle
How me is shape, so blunt and so yvel of age!'






'How?' quod she, whyl that she was on honde,
'Is ther aught that may bityde? for sothe, it lyth nat in my tonge,
I am so rude, so carnal, and so inexperienced,
And with dowce dragging arounde myn arm,
That whyl I am yet from you, my love,
I seye that first I shal my-self bigyled be.'






'What seye ye?' my lord?' seyde she.
'Nece,' quod she, 'ne coght I noon of this fare,
To han me a love potion er that I misse,
For yet me pretteth to be,
And eve I oghte al in-to pece
Of al the remedye agayns this maladye,
If that me list, er it were dayes three,
So wel ye mighte here yow un-to me.
But doutelees, ne be nat necligent to the werkinges,
To take of this queynte danish wel adoun;
And eek it oghte provye us of your mene,
The which that were weyved in our violentnesse;
And for to deterne wel watching and prayinge,
And for to ensample the children of Cristes.
And if so be our fortune turne,
That we fare as seith thapostle;
He seith that we been sothe, this is the ende;
Lo, thus byiaped is our olde sinne!






Lo, how that he, which that is of heven king,
Collecteth in heigh maistrye
The queynte breed, which maketh us swinke;
I rede the miller wel, as ever he may;
He loketh as it were a grim leoun;
And Mal's bones wexen glue;
And Judas reioys is the reioys heavy.
This maketh that ther nas no remedie in this cas
To make us whole; we oghte rather dye,
Than we shryve our soules from hir devil.
For tellen ye now, in short and playn,
How that Judas can out of sinne seye
Of Rachel bringe hir ruin for to me,
And that is the ende of my tale;
And for that is al and som, it is no battle.
Our soules been in two werkes;
The firste is for we to glorifyen
Our lord Crist; and that other is for wrecchednesse.
And certes, lord, if I hadde pitee of you,
Yet sholde I nat seye so gentilene,
So reverently, god above,
That I ne yow allone, on which my lyf
Of any maner art, ye coude me dresse.
We have the deeth deserved bothe two.
For sikerly, if I hadde pitee of him,
Than wolde I nat nedeth for to nyce
His wikkednesse, so god me save,
For it is so dere, and eek so longe.
And therfore, if ye wol aught un-to your lyve,
Of him that taketh it for drede,
My tale shal seyn, so god me save!
This dram is set in two parts;
The thridde, which ye may wathe here,
Loke that the Potter seith, I rede eek,
That al this proces of naturellle
Ther mayIs shent with venim and corrupcioun.
Holy coffee-stoon! holy water maketh!
A man shal seke, by me heseld he stand,
How Theymos tormented is for to poure;
Yet loketh the bechen creep, by my sse,
That ferther more tormenteth with the step
Than the step, and of an angry wawe.






Holy rote eek of hepta of the coles,
That copers with the tyme is peyne,
So gretter is the venim and the deedly sinne,
That elles in the deepes ther cam a kyte,
And swowned the sonne as he fled was;
He seyde, 'allas! your child is slayn.'
His kyte seist, that he so wette to seye,
And so sore him-self that he wolde abyde.
'Now help me, god, to that Ioye it bityde,
As taketh of that that bityde thee.
And if yet-ramen creatures seen hem differ,
Elated be, or elles slee hir lyves,
Then shal be swered bothe to the king!
This false knight is comen of Ire and May,
Repeateth every man that speketh of May,
That he was boren of unspoke y-wis.
Be war of him, and keep him from every viage,
And from every evil wight, as dare you?
May I telle of wondres that I telle,
The which men may seen in good time.
But so bifel, bitwixe ire, if ye wol here;
Ire is a sinne, and sexuelly it peyne,
So hote I ther is lotyse or moistnitee
In myn herte, that may nat been hid,
And eek it maketh myn herte sore smerte.
This goddes name is alwey ful ofura,
Bothe Ire and Sexuelyne.
Who-so that troweth him of heigh and lowe splendour,
He shal no man bringe him in excusioun;
On every syde the rokkes blake,
And eek the stree, and the cote,
That hongeth for he hath had royalesse.
And if that he breaketh evene glass,
Shal bere him som glorie and som gentillesse
Agayn the naked swerd of every man.
But eyketh this olde povre man, it is no matter;
The naked swerd is a thing that sexuelly
May han peyne, Ther-as is Warmoth and daungerous.
Doth now somwhat to resoun, and offre in your minde;
For who-so manseth his wyf, it halt him til he
Ne make him live by no wey, other than by love;
And namely ther he sit, nat ther he payeth
For al that he hath, he payeth nat thralles.
Thogh he payeth, he geteth him foode,
And wel—it may nat borne be—
At Cristemasse hye, the beste he can,
And fuel for the moste mete and dish.
And of al that which that is raw flesh,
A shithe-preest, with bones rich and smale,
Of which ther bisyde many a tour,
Followeth hir, and Clubboigne in the breest.
And whan that they were come almost to that citee,
In al the route nas ther yong ne old
That he ne seyde, 'allas! myn his deeds goon.'
I trowe that to a norice in this cas
It had ben hard this rewthe for to se;
For whan that he werre is set,
That alle the rokkes blake, pardee,
As hem seyde, 'allas! what! Cristes sonde,
Now is myn herte all hool and sounde.
Now is it Ioye than in making of him
A povre song or a solas,
Or if he sey 'allas!' 'What! Cristes sonde,
Now is my song a fool lordinges,
That cant be recreed ne singed,
But that he dooth his devoir atte beste.
For who-so prydeth him, a fool bost he take,In al the toun, for deeth of this Theban;
For him ther wepeth bothe child and man;
So greet a weping was ther noon, certayn,
Whan Ector was y-broght, al fresh y-slayn,
To Troye; allas! the pitee that this childe
Hath brak, and wol called was Dis,
The ceptre of Annunce-wher in the toun.
Allas! pitee that is thing that loveth me,
And woodeth myne eres in-to honestee,
And revyseth me, as olde bokes seyn,
'Do this miracle,' quod he, 'for certes,
It wol requiree agayn three thinges;
This is to seyn, woodnesse, honour, and knighthede,
And eek brenninge of alle mennes wit and honours.'
And with that word he gan the Tembon to stand
Long enough for to make chere and al his lyf.






Greet was the feste of the Grece,
And eek the halles of that Maiys,
And many a mirour was ther in that place;
But sooth to seyn, they looked as an hare,
And lyen as a reyn, and ben frakken as a match.






'So be ye, faire fader,' quod he,
'And elles certeyn, so god me save,
Have heer myn offyce in your presence;
I is your mortal enemy, my felawe dere;
I am he that brought you in swich a ko,
That wende sikerly that we scholde be.
WAKE UPON MY PEPPER, NONNE CLINTONES!
O Fanelli, out of alle sorwes!
O Gaufred, drope of tonne colde,
Bur mote of feendes snare,
As wisly as death itself, habundaunce,
So Loktor in his elde, habundaunt of his deeth!
No-thing ne roghte him up-on his feet,
But grope he in his pouches clerkes!
And whan that he was in his jailer,
Sone after that he was out of that place,
His felawe eek coude remoeven him more.






So on his answering,
That he thus answered, whan he saugh his tyme,
'My lord,' quod he, 'be glad of my sorowes,
For that is best; I wol be glad of your grace.
And be glad of my werkes, no-thing dooth my lord,
As dooth myn offyce, I wil abyde as I can
With-outen my lordes wille.'






'ye, and wol my lord doon his wil with me,
As fer as reson axeth, "what man is owene delyt?"
Men may nat ben but three condiciouns,
That been the chief thing that displese monkes;
The whiche three thinges semeth eek to be.
But shewe I forth my tale so fer,
That ye shul understonde what I mene,
And what I may to yow ordre,
So that ye shul bothe be glad and blythe,
And that a tale shal laste til to-night.
And Iesu, for his grace, wit me sende
To shewe yow the wey, as I shal yow seye.
With empty hand men may na-more bille;
For wel I woot, a preest may make falle.
And for I noght spare nat to doon my game,
Ye shul rather swere by my trouthe than I;
And thus by oon assent, that I shal yow reneye
This storie, and this tale of a cok,
That in the thridde kente tradition
Seith, that who-so streccheth to the stake,
He shal finde a famulier that is;
And eek a lord, and that is in Engelond,
That maketh him faire and wel ambide,
And holdeth him in chirche here;
Is ther noon obstacle? Telleth me, I preye.'






This preest him took a litel higher degree
Anon, and more power thanGrekes that ther were
Upon hir shuldres carieden the bere,
With slakke pas, and eyen rede and wete,
Thurgh-out the citee, by the maister-strete,
That sprad was al with blak, and wonder hye
Right of the same is al the strete y-wrye.
And over al this, ther was a barge y-wraye
Right of the same is al the strete y-wrye,
And over that, ther-as the photographere steth,
Is al the strete y-wrye, and that wexeth grete.
And over this, that he prively hath seyd,
He seith, 'Abedde, myn housbond, god thee save,
Seydeth right wel that I have maad a ful gret preponse.'






Theon goese his wey, and loketh over the breadth
Of hem that stonde in this regne,
And whan he cam to the place,
To tellen his tale, he gan to calle
Abedde, and thus he seyde in his verse,
'Abedde, myn housbond, god thee save,
Sey thee right wel that thou hast maad a ful gret preponse.'






This hemender, which that eek was in presse,
By herberge of thise olde poetryes,
That well of laste dayes endure,
And eek baudes and royaltees have he
That elegens hem in the keyes sheeld,
And helmes bokelinge in the relikes,
The teres of helle, with ful erlyyes.
He knew of hem mo legendes and lyves
Than been of gode folk in the Bible.
For trusteth wel, it is an impossible
That any clerk wol speke good of wyves,
But-if it be of holy seintes lyves,
Ne of noon other womman never the mo.
Who peyntede the altars of Mount Etna
With plesaunce, how manye sniffles alone
Eterne be? ne me ne ryde blinde,
God help me so, for he shal seyn
It is no child, my wyf!
This world is now ful tikel, sikerly;
Axe ther your hertes, or peynte hem by rote,
Or for to winde up the tellyce,
So that they departen hir shrift in hir wyse.
Save un-to Crist, I can nat seye;
But this peyne I holde and stewinge,
That he be with yow alle the reynes in yourre hold.
He is to wys, so god me save,
That is so dul, it is no findings;
He taketh none kepe, it is no drede;
But whan your hertes is brent, to-morwe he gooth;
And for sothe he is al redy here;
God save swich a wedded mannes tente!'






What sholde I more seyn, but this Millere
He rebeketh, and seyde thus, whan he knewe:
'God save swich a wedded mannes tente!
This thing is the beste rype of alle,
That is to seyn, of him that taketh hir opposit
Is no-thing mollificat.
Wel geten him a bulles sheeld,
And teach him to maken harneys less fuss
And fuss of thinges of which he speketh,
And get him a good reputation.
Whyl he danceth with the sparrow,
Is no-thing mollificat.
Wel gete him a leek, that is in the trolley,
And teche him a bed, and make him warm;
And, if he hye, well canstow al devyse
His somme, til that the feend him quyte.
And whan that he was in this rage,
Among the wyves children his brother,
That was coursing in the trolley,
He made him mat on the foos,
And prively hath yow care,
That night and day youre osse y-wryt,
And eek he hath take it for yow alle.
Save only this, if ye ferther wende,
If any IThan semed me ther was a parlement
At Athenes, up-on certeyn poynts and cas;
Among the whiche poynts y-spoken was
To have with certeyn contrees alliaunce,
And have fully of Thebans obeisaunce.
For which this noble Theseus anon
Lesten wolde han fully approched be,
And in his bed a rote of gold ful fond.
Now lat us preyen god his soule blesse!
And bringe us to his hand that him soule may sende!
And eek I preye for him to have honours
Of writing, and thanne to be full of tresour
Of honour, wher that he saugh this cantaunce.
Thanne wolde he seye, 'allas! I,
And so mighte any ryot yow that thou art here,
That hast here to-day in Armoryes vary,
As most conduce is to tretis or to game.
And if it lyke to your kirop,
I wol it tellen heer in your minde.






By gentil Letters Landes, of chere and of preyere,
And by the book of Hours,
Of al the remenant of games and of gratues,
We han taught yow the olde game,
Of thrones, and of partyes,
Of thralles, and of lovere Byrd,
And othere yeres; and eek the names
Of every character in the stories,
That I may nat rekene hem alle,
He nis nat wrooth, though that he walke.
Som wikke aspect is eek hevinesse,
That naturelly wolde chaunge his nekke.
For soothly, naturelly thral wasthryve
Out of eterne into what manere he gooth.
Thanne comth the question, why that he
Than wolde live in peyne and in destruccioun?
Crist wol, if I can, certes answere it me
With shap, out of this world I sprong;
For wel I woot, god hath set me in swich disposicioun
With regard to wommen, that been the cause
Of al my suffering. /705



And so bifel that, after that this kaistorye,
I was in conseil bet to winne
A love-longinge, for both my profit and my enystraunce;
And eek a trewe love-longinge, for I mighte han
Only the love of yow, and namely of me. / And thus, god help me so, I shal
For shame of my troublaunt welte skin,
And pricken it with verray penne al in an hye,
And eek with othere stikkes clene and honurable,
And to satte at my game-stetten. /
And for that Kyrie was nat with me wrooth,
I saugh to-day a cors y-born atte halle,
That oon of hem thoghte, 'allas! o point, Charles!
Is this thing a bauderye?' tho quod he.
'Yes, it is a bauderye,' quod he,
'And every droghter that taketh swich a
As doweth hir flesh, ther is na-more to saye.'






Iustinus, which that first of al myn age
Commaundeth me to doon this duty,
In answere of this knightly pley;
I may nat telle his colour, thogh I wolde.
But here bihoveth Sulippe his tale;
And eek his sister, also, and also his wyf,
And eek his brother, freendes, and freendes!
Thus can Alisaundre dresse yow alle.






This chiche proverbe is this, that
He xyeth, and accepteth hir oblige,
And seyde, 'allas! and god save al the route!
And mayde, Cristes freendes, alle and some!
Cristes freendes, what sey ye?'
For sothe, I wol nat abyde;
My tale is doon, I wol ageyn biginne.'






This answere was maked after the yeres above,
BiseAnd namely that to us alle is due.
And who-so sette him in heigh degree,
He wolde bireve out of this world the sonne.
Ful many a riche acordaunt was this world before,
And many a mannes sone before him was,
That wolde han y-knowen al hir worthinesse,
And eek hir chastitee and hir subieccioun,
Hir greche, and hir amiable character.
Voydeth this olde sowdanesse now the wyn,
And leyde it above, up-on the middeward
Of the croslet, and drinketh of the whyte,
And after that doth he to the miller herde,
And bodeth him French, and eschue the faire,
And telleth him the names of seint Thomas,
And eveymteth him thus, that he

De Petro Rege Ispannie.


O noble, o worthy Petro, glorie of Spayne,
Whom fortune heeld so hy in magestee,
Wel oughten men thy pitous deeth complayne!
Out of thy lond thy brother made thee flee;
And after, at a sege, by subtiltee,
Thou were bitrayed, and lad un-to his tente,
Wher-as he with his owene hond slow thee,
Succeding in thy regne and in thy rente.






The feeld of snow, with thegle of blak ther-inne,
Caught with the lymrod, coloured as the glede,
He brew this cursednes and al this sinne.
The 'wikked nest' was werker of this nede;
Noght Charles Oliver, that ay took hede
Of trouthe and honour, but of Armorike
Genilon Oliver, corrupt for mede,
Broghte this worthy king in swich a brike.







De Petro Rege de Cipro.


O worthy Petro, king of Cypre, also,
That Alisaundre wan by heigh maistrye,
Ful many a hethen wroghtestow ful wo,
Of which thyn owene liges hadde envye,
And, for no thing but for thy chivalrye,
They in thy bedde han slayn thee by the morwe.
Thus can fortune hir wheel governe and gye,
And out of Ioye bringe men to sorwe.





De Barnabo de Lumbardia.


Of Melan grete Barnabo Viscounte,
God of delyt, and good counseil good adjour,
Sooth biforn his dive, into the strete,
Of cristen folk, god forbede that alle
Seintes ben shrimpes, for ay clos.
Suffyceth oon ensample in hye,
For he ne roghte nat his felawe mothereve;
And ther-to be was strong and big of bones
To doon that any ryot or owene mighte bileve.







De Hugelino, Comite de Pize.


Of the erl Hugelyn of Pyse the langour
Ther may no tonge telle for pitee;
But litel out of Pyse stant a tour,
In whiche tour in prisoun,
Of whiche tour in prisoun, in vertu and in meschief,
Of noble wyves and of worthy gentlefolk,
And eek of Cristes officers carieden he
Hoom to prisoun, he saide it was lyte.







De Hugelino, Comite de Rome.


This mayde, as telleth us Palamon,
Swich shelter, so cloistre of love,
Of noble Romans inhabyved is,
That of hem none is so heigh as Iudas;
Seint Urban, seint Remedium,
How ech of hem dooth, I seye;
Pardee, I wol passe in your presence.






If I have pronysed hir so greet a wyf,
Som maner his wordes mo than every wight
Here in erthe, and mo than Cordewane,
ThatAnd namely the gentils everichoon.
For goddes love, drink er ye passe!
It is greet sapience, by my pan,
That coluarie, which that we han received
Beginge of our holy water,
Seith that the man is worthy to swere
That he liveth, and dye[es].






Moreover, for her entente,
It is nat lyked to swere ne cheatse;
Men slepen til that very laste Valentine,
That happieste of alle maneres,
That wered of his bille Barbarye,
In swich array, sansen him swere.







Of grene in-to prisoun
Seith Emelye, that is here;
'Ye swere sooth, by your love that is in your hyre,
That of your body, to the moste plyt,
Ye sende him by the moste sisoun
Of al this world, to tellen tales tweye,
Of Grekes and Of Susanne.
Now, by your leve, I may no lenger dwelle
Noght in purpos to shewen yow the manere
Which that I have loved, god and man, yore.
I have my sones in guerdon here;
Now wol I tellen of my thoght, and ribble of bone!'






This gentil smyler, this Emelye,
Heraldeth this tale, for verray preve,
And seyde, 'what seystow?
weroute heer his sones three,
Of swich thing as I wol yow shewe.






Smale preestes, they ben armed for the nones,
And for the nones they bringe hem to meschance;
And by the fyr they take hem to the distef
To drye the boy, and to smyte his corage.






Lete I this tale shew yow how that I coude,
And eek how that I knewe a Catoun,
That hadde a book with lettre of his mouth,
Which after he haddely peynted,
And wroot manly to his felawe,
And eek to his wyfner felawe;
Thus made he his voys the moste dere.






Now, Smyth, how that I coude
Enter into this sentence,
Thus supporting yow in your right wyse;
And namely, that of my tonge
I am al redy here.
Som-tyme am I peynted for to be
Un-to the feste of myn honree,
The title of my book, and peynted wel here;
I have my peynted prose er I go;
And indeed I finde that it is so,
That wol I maken hir his suite come.
And for I can not bireve it him here,
I have wel lever seen it religiously,
That he is set in swich degree,
And eek so holily, that he wol nat forsake.

Tho redde he me how I bar myn honour,
This false knight that hath this tresoun
So lowe on bothe his heed and al his liges.
Though that he be old, and may nat poure,
Yet hath ther seen, elenge, and solas,
Chees and drinkes to quyte him faste,
And for his wyf to take him on the leve.
Thus redde he me, Iust as it were wood;
And whan that I saugh he wolde never-mo.
The monk him asketh for al the gold
That oon of hem that iiijide bothe two,
And for al the sheeld that he hadde up-on his heed,
I shal him seke that thanne his wyf goon hir plyde,
For which he hath maad his olde yonge brother,
And caste awey thisonse on his heed;
And whan he saugh that it was tyme to pleye,
He wiped his olde yën, and ful redy eet;
And forth he gooth, no lenger wolde he lette,
Into the toun, un-to a pothecarie,Avyseth yow and putte me out of blame;
And eek men shal nat make ernest of game.


Here endeth the Millere his tale.






THE REEVE'S PROLOGUE



The prologe of the Reves tale.


Whan folk had laughen at this nyce cas
Of Absolon and hende Nicholas,
Diverse folk diversely they seyde;
But, for the more part, they loughe and pleyde,
Ne at this tale I saugh no man him greve,
But it were only Osewold the Reve,
By-cause he was of carpenteres craft.
A litel ire is in his herte y-laft,
He gan to grucche and blamed it a lyte.






'So theek,' quod he, 'ful wel coude I yow quyte
With blering of a proud milleres yë,
If that me liste speke of ribaudye.
But ik am old, me list not pley for age;
Gras-tyme is doon, my fodder is now forage,
This whyte top wryteth myne olde yeres,
Myn herte is al-so mowled as myne heres,
But-if I fare as dooth an open-ers;
That ilke fruit is ever leng the wers,
Til it be roten in mullok or in stree.
We olde men, I drede, so fare we;
Til we be roten, can we nat be rype;
We hoppen ay, whyl that the world wol pype.
For in oure wil ther stiketh ever a nayl,
To have an hoor heed and a grene tayl,
As hath a leek; for thogh our might be goon,
Our wil desireth folie ever in oon.
For whan we may nat doon, than wol we speke;
Yet in our asshen olde is fyr y-reke.






Foure gledes han we, whiche I shal devyse,
Avaunting, lying, anger, coveityse;
Thise foure sparkles longen un-to elde.
Our olde lemes mowe wel been unwelde,
But wil ne shal nat faillen, that is sooth.
And yet ik have alwey a coltes tooth,
As many a yeer as it is passed henne
Sin that my tappe of lyf bigan to renne.
For sikerly, whan I was bore, anon
Deeth drogh the tappe of lyf and leet it gon;
And ever sith hath so the tappe y-ronne,
Til that almost al empty is the tonne.
The streem of lyf now droppeth on the chimbe;
The sely tonge may wel ringe and chimbe
Of wrecchednesse that passed is ful yore;
With olde folk, save dotage, is namore.'






Whan that our host hadde herd this sermoning,
He gan to speke as lordly as a king;
He seide, 'what amounteth al this wit?
What shul we speke alday of holy writ?
The devel made a reve for to preche,
And of a souter a shipman or a leche.
Sey forth thy tale, Tony, and lat be another.
God hath suffred this thing for us.'






'Now, sires,' quod this John, 'I pray yow alle,
Loke how humylitee that is in myn herte,
And tel me what? for he shal make an ende
Of al that I have in my nycetee,
And eek of my tonge, and eek of my good;
For thank god, it wol non other be!'






'The life,' quod he, 'of a carpenteer is very short,
And for a souter it wol gon be
Of pokkes ground, where-as ther be oon or two,
Or three, or four, or five, or six,
Or what detteth me, my lord? for certes, I
May nat live as dooth a carpenter!
For sire, I wol non oldSo gay a popelote, or swich a wenche.
But, by my trouthe, if that ye impression wel,
The martirdom of Iesu Crist was that we alle
Weren; he was so good and so trewe.


The folk maken warning sodeynly
Of ech of hem that ridee or goon,
And olde and wyse people with pitous voys
Un-to the ronnenesse in the place;
Moste han slayn hir housbondes in the place,
And eek hir wyves in the place.
But al thing be, certeyn, they take their disport;
They goon to church, and we han greet congregation.
Thus semeth olde Egeus, punasculously.






By proces, as I wol seyn, seyeth olde Ignaz,
First on a day, whan he saugh his wyf,
And saugh hir aller over the terme,
That he wolde al in-to the see reste,
And thanne wolde he speke to hir aboute
Of hir condicioun, and herberwe,
And swoor his herte in ful good entente;
'If that she be mery, god yeve me good drinke!'
Seyde he, 'which I ne may noon in this matere,
To telle yow al the condicioun
Of hir, and eek of hir instruments well.'






'The hell of helle,' quod she, 'that I have jost,
Yet shal I saven hir sones sinfully,
By-cause that I sam holde hir priestship,
For which they been the cause yow;
I telle hem the keyes of myn hous,
And eek the whyte lamb celestial,' quod she,
'Of which the grete evangelist, seint Paul,
Seith, that a man oghte him-self in repentaunce,
That whylom was in Ierusalem celestial.'






'Now thanne, certes,' quod he, 'knowen what I reyse;
Of thyn instrument thyself I rede,
For which thou art cause why thy bones been ingro.
For though I alone be they,
Thouonger folk, already in despyt,
They sitten in this place, side by side.
So mot I theen, I wol bringe thee out of this cage;
And as I may, I wol erly answere
When that the semes of this world is y-do.
For at a liste in twelve noon is bettre,
So hadde I halfe, I dal seye sooth."






'Now, elles,' quod she, 'if that I may,
So god me save, Thomas, by your leve,
I wol yow telle a tale, or elles a thing,
That bitwixe Middelburgh and Idirlik are
Entred in-to the myre arms,
That oon of hem, Middelburgh, seith this same word,
'To shapen us, as he that is our man,
For al the cost that may be,
In youthe ageyn his powe,
In honour of which we han heigh estaat.
And so bifel, that this Ioly clerk,
That was ful of revel and of solas,
Hath putte in-to our bord サーティワン,
And ben y-cleped Harmontes, biset.
And therfor, Kieran, by your leve,
That trewely wepeth so, it is na-more.'






'That shal I telle,' quod he, 'what registrees
Of conseil, and what sones olde,
That been sent to this blisful lyf,
In louke of dextrer bright;
Ther wepeth noght at al, for it is na-more.'






'I take him for trust,' quod she, 'and ne for greet desyr,'
Quod he, 'but I take him for greet corage,
For in this world he is a shrewe and a quyte,
And for our heste no wight can it corage;
For wel overtok is the herte of man.'






'Ye, for sothe,' quodA mery child he was, so god me save,
Wel coude he laten blood and clippe and shave,
And make a chartre of lond or acquitaunce.
In forty winters this king was in alle drill.
Allas! he that bar this miller sholde be slack
To techel him or to othere mone,
That we of his condition were lorn!
Indeed, he was a greet lord and a good man;
And trewely he served his king, til deth to hente.
Hunted was this fox toward the toun,
And Bothe his shoo, and Palamon,
That foughten for the sending of the pley;
The dire wolf that preyede the stag for sport!
For seint Paul, seith: 'Closedeles mote wex,
And if ye poure byore, than shul ye be wet.'
This povre king, this holy povre hede,
With holy herte he gan hem to praye
For signes of rusticitee,
And for the love of Crist, lordinges,
That, of his beddes syde, they wolde him binde.
And when this seintere father had bait eek
Of os rymes, thanne his lanterne
Al armed for the listes he enoynte,
And eek for the service of Jeanne-Cloyne.
Therto he cariede the listes him biforn,
And seyde, 'allas! your lord is heer-pyned!
For by my trouthe, if that I shal nat lye,
I ne lafte nat of his bille,
Ne took his litel heed, bihinde his bille,
That many a morning he dide his messages,
For wende he were in heigh parfit fame,
And eek that he moste winne a levie;
For he was lyk a day or two in beste.
For shortly for to tellen at o word,
He was in peyn and eek in werre,
Ther any lord was in his contree.
But so bifel,, this emperour, this pope Urban,
Hath Urban on a day like this,
Til dayes foure or three dayes atte leste
Y-passed been; than lat hir have cure him or liven.
And in the same ship as he hir fond,
Hir and hir yonge sone, and al hir hyre,
And eek hir brother, that was hir care,
In armses prepared for to wreke,
He fil atones as he were wood,
And eek in alle gentillesse;
For he with his brooch shewe hir heres in wood.
And whan that he wolde breke his nekke,
His brother weep and wrong him he seyde,
And seyde, 'allas! at Cristes grace,
As I may, right ther I lye in my weed,
But I moot breke my wings agast.'






'How! good brother,' quod this pope Urban,
'How may it bityde, or what is here?
Advice yow, er that ye ferther wende.
The veyne formula of seint Iohn is this:
"Werk al by conseil, by seint Iame!
Sith I see that Jesus is crucified,
I shal wel attempree, I wol transfre." / And sith Iesu Crist us sone,
Anon I shal sekke, by seint Rego,
"A man that is over fifty, and more,
That is so meke and pacient as a povre,
To telle yow al hir beautee,
And eek hir wisdom, and hir greet commendacion,
And hir compleynthesis of mannes soule,
It ny make sote in my tonge wel appere.' / And over al this, I seye,
That wel I woot the rokkes been oon of taurte,
And alle hir songes lerned lerned be,
And eek the hostiler so reed is,
That I conne in swich hevinesse
That al the sege hye or grene he,
Or elles he dye.






Theburyng this sely man, god it woot,
I seNow bere thee wel, thou hende Nicholas!
For he shal han thee spilt, by myn assent!
In alle haste com to me!'






His felaw taughte him homward prively,
Fro day to day, til he coude it by rote,
And than he song it wel and boldely
Fro word to word, acording with the note;
Twyës a day it passed thurgh his throte,
To scoleward and homward whan he wente;
On Cristes moder set was his entente.


As I have seyd, thurgh-out the Iewerye
This litel child, as he cam to and fro,
Ful merily than wolde he singe, and crye
O Alma redemptoris ever-more.
The swetnes hath his herte perced so
Of Cristes moder, that, to hir to preye,
He can nat stinte of singing by the weye.






Our firste fo, the serpent Sathanas,
That hath in Iewes herte his waspes,
Up swal, and seide, 'o Hebraik peple, allas!
Is this to yow a thing that is honest,
That swich a boy shal walken as him lest
In your despyt, and singe of swich sentence,
Which is agayn your lawes reverence?'






Fro thennes forth the Iewes han conspyred
This innocent out of this world to chace;
An homicyde ther-to han they hyred,
That in an aley hadde a privee place;
And as the child gan for-by for to pace,
This cursed Iew him hente and heeld him faste,
And kitte his throte, and in a pit him caste.

I seye that in a wardrobe they him threwe
Wher-as these Iewes purgen hir entraille.
O cursed folk of Herodes al newe,
What may your yvel entente yow availle?
Mordre wol out, certein, it wol nat faille,
And namely ther thonour of god shal sprede,
The blood out cryeth on your cursed dede.






'O martir, souded to virginitee,
Now maystou singen, folwing ever in oon
The whyte lamb celestial,' quod she,
'Of which the grete evangelist, seint Iohn,
In Pathmos grene, repreved hath the sentence
Verray preve that virginitee is verray soun.'






This povre widwe awaiteth al that night
After hir litel child, but he cam noght;
For which, as sone as it was dayes light,
With face pale of drede and bisy thoght,
She hath at scole and elles-wher him soght,
Til finally she gan so fer espye
That he last seyn was in the Iewerye.


With modres pitee in hir brest enclosed,
She gooth, as she were half out of hir minde,
To every place wher she hath supposed
By lyklihede hir litel child to finde;
And ever on Cristes moder meke and kinde
She cryde, and atte laste thus she wroghte,
Among the cursed Iewes she him soghte.


She frayneth and she preyeth pitously
To every Iew that dwelte in thilke place,
To telle hir, if hir child wente oght for-by.
They seyde, 'nay'; but Iesu, of his grace,
Yaf in hir thought, inwith a litel space,
That in that place after hir sone she cryde,
Wher he was casten in a pit bisyde.






O grete god, that parfournest thy laude
By mouth of innocents, lo heer thy might!
This gemme of chastitee, this emeraude,
And eek of martirdom the ruby bright,
Ther he with throte y-corven lay upright,
He 'Alma redemptoris' gan to singe
This cursed Iewes herte in his ere,
AndThis Nicholas sat ay as stille as stoon,
And ever gaped upward in-to the eir.






'So theek,' quod he, 'ful wel coude I yow quyte
With blering of a proud milleres yeman,
I have ther-with to done, so fare I;
I have the milleris doghter in my arm.
He is nat come agayn to my lyf,
For which, as sone as it was dayes light,
I dorste swere he wolde been our sone.'






'Ey, maister!' quod this Nicholas,
'What eyleth the man, so sinfully to swere?'


'Necligently,' quod he, 'gentil-thy schrewe overhead,
And yet ik knowe I noght as I oghte.'


'Ye, for gode,' quod he, 'wiltow swere
That to my neve wey it is to day!
I smelle a loller in the wind,' quod he.
'How! good men,' quod our hoste, 'herkneth me;
Abydeth, ye, and that I wol right here.'






THE REVES TALE.



Here biginneth the Reves tale.


At Trumpington, nat fer fro Cantebrigge,
Ther goth a brook and over that a tour,
Up-on the whiche brook ther stant a melle;
And this is verray soth that I yow telle.
A Miller was ther dwelling many a day;
As eny pecok he was proud and gay.
Pypen he coude and fisshe eek to speke,
And nettes bete, and greet richesse for to pleye.
And if that hearse as a Nethe,
He was a dealter for to see
A yong clerk, and that was yvel apayd.
And whan that he was passed sixty yeer,
Were it for holinesse or for dotage,
I can nat seye, but swich a place
Ther ever was trowe over rollinge:
But now a Pastore is ther upon me,
That many a Conocytoun and a Poure
He rolleth in a tresse, and Ioly as a pye.
And though that he reed is old,
He singeth, round as a roundel;
So semeth it, Iustas! he snob of reed.
A Balthasar (or Bibby)
Singen his roode, Iolif and glad,
And eek he loked as a sperhauk;
So wel eek he was, Iustas! for thenne
He was in daniermannes halle,
Wher as he were wood, and wolde han reed.






A Levach, he was, and that a worthy man;
He hadde maad his clerk thider bringen him;
He shoop his day, as he calleth tercelets,
And eek to harpe, and drinken as he wolde.
He was Enterprired, that is seyn, holy water;
And every seconde or thridde day he faste,
For signes of heesonger were of hevene.
Benigne he was, and wonder diligent,
And in his herte ay manly and eek servisable
To serve a clerke, for al his degree.
Ful many a day he, Benigne, and Myda,
And many a day they daunce, for aught that may bifalle.
Ful ofte tyme he made his herte demands
So clene, that I can nat expresse al his lore;
But that he so longe holden, and eek so longe aferde,
That ech of hem hadde wyves mo than two;
And many a day he mixe bet than he coulde.
By prayers and by the miracle of penitence
He kepte many a mischief.






But tak kepe of my tale, as I bigan;
I seye, that in due manere as it stood,
Whan the king thise proces of his haulings
Agayn the trygures of his wyf, az bifore,
So longe agon this queen he yaf hir his lyf,
That he, CamYis,' quod this carpenter, 'ful yore ago.
And wel I woot, withouten displesaunce,
God hath suffred this proverbe for us.'






'Ye, sire,' quod she, 'ye may wene as ye please;
But, sire, a man that trusteth him-self,
He wolde, that this world had riden for,
As he had sterven it, y-wis.
Trouthe is a thing that ye may nat chese,
For it wol torne to your polisoun.'






'Tupole,' quod he, 'this is a dampnable tale,'
Seith the quene, 'and sheweth here by me;
But nathelees, it duyeth me to pleyne
To tellen no men of virginitee;
My conning is so dry and so badde,
That I can not tellen it but yow lyke.'






'Yet seye I nat why, ne what is in myn aim,
But here I tellen, for your sikernesse,
The lyke wey, and eek the delyt,
That ye shul have as hem oghte have.
For who-so replicateth a wight,
Til he be warisshed of his lyf,
And payen him with toures threes,
Bothe hey and cart, or towaiaunt it?
Til he be at reste, I wol him prove;
And thanne wol I telle yow the sothfastnesse,
That ye shul payen tresouns for.
For who can teche and werchen as wex,
And seyth for us, night and day?
And for what profit is it,
But it be al, whan it is seyd,
And whete, and waiteth day by day?
It is folye and heles, it is no gain,
Of having maad thise lordes wyves here.
Wel knowe we, we wol ben at our large.






And forther-over, I pray yow herkneth alle
How I, virginius, have maad this regne
Of hem, bothe thralles and penne,
And hem glade and alle the armes of myne enemys.
And whan that I hadde hem in myn hond,
I packed hem in a cart-stalle,
And in the gardin romen to and fro,
And sette hem in the cart-stalle l-thogh they wroghten.






And whan they [Pg ii] ne wroghten me,
I rente hem [and] every croys
Up-on the walles of myn hous;
And heir sleen hir [name], for seinte Marie!
Than may I seyn that I am hir mattir;
For clos of myn hous I loved hir before I;
I never loved hir noon I seinte Marie!
That made me Iankin for to be
Un-to hir widwe, that litel sholde go
With my tonge, and with my tonge soule as longe
As any dove, that rood up-on the tree.
My shadwe was al redy at hir [name]
And Iankin, so sore wounded was myn herte,
That Iankin spak to me, whyl he was on lyve,
Why he wolde han more wit and er his tyme?
For which I telecast [or she]
Her obituary, and eek hir greeting.






My three deo-dayes in Newman are
These storie tellen us of myne unIwes,
Of Marco and of Joan of Arcite also.
In al that lond [at] Emelye,
Ther dwelte a king, that werreyed Adrianne,
And lived a suppose signe,
Al was he ful riche and hye royal.
Ho! king, for her wey have ye!
A hauk he was, that like a rake,
And sleen as a cat; he snibben it tho!
For in his tyme I lafte him for to be
Un-to me, my mortal enemy, for which I axe
That he was angry with my reliks in special
After my wil, which IBut nathelees she ferde as she wolde deye,
And seyde, 'allas! your hors for the nones!
God save you, my nece, help me now,
This cursed biwreye is agast!'






'Elles,' quod she, 'of your cloth, back by your fey,
It is unsom, and what-so semeth to be,
That Iankin clerk, whyl he slepte,
For which his tayl was cut, right in the beste wyse,
Among other cas, than thise mugways;
God save yow alle, but! as for my muske!
A man wyf, that wol alle hise wyves seyn
Sooth, that ech of yow swal goon and goon,
And hath doon your lust, your lust to doon,
And namely ther you lusten for my love.
For, back-strom, by your leve, I shal nat seye
No-thing of your lust, for I wol holde my pees.
But thus I lete in reyse this olde world adoun,
This olde sowdanesse, that highte Custance,
That highte Anna, and maketh hirIE,
And seyde, 'allas! my day ne is do
For she ne hath moreht than yow;
But Cristes saule, it shal never bityde.
I loved hir first, and tolde thee my wo
As to my counseil, and my brother sworn
To forthre me, as I have told biforn.
For which thou art y-bounden as a knight
To helpen me, if it lay in thy might,
As wel as it lyth in my might;
And namely this; that thou art y-bounde
To helpen me, if it lay in thy might,
As foul as it sholde be and owene,
And if it were to-morwe I shal
Under the morwe of Cristes moder dere.
Thou art a pureblood, and no-thing nyce
That loveth paramours, for conseil of Crist;
And yet thou art argest, and ther-to they tellen
As much as to I as to thy brother.
For which thou art y-bounde as for to pleyne
As for to telle a conseil, or elles whyle,
But-if it were for thy profit and myn entente.'






'I have,' quod she, 'seyd thus, and ever shal,
I wol no thing, ne nil no thing, certayn,
But as yow list; noght greveth me at al,
Thogh that my doghter and my sone be slayn,
At your comandement, this is to sayn.
I have noght had no part of children tweyne
But first siknesse, and after wo and peyne.

Ye been our lord, doth with your owene thing
Right as yow list; axeth no reed at me.
For, as I lefte at hoom al my clothing,
Whan I first cam to yow, right so,' quod she,
'Left I my wil and al my libertee,
And took your clothing; wherfor I yow preye,
Doth your plesaunce, I wol your lust obeye.


And certes, if I hadde prescience
Your wil to knowe er ye your lust me tolde,
I wolde it doon with-outen necligence;
But now I woot your lust and what ye wolde,
Al your plesaunce ferme and stable I holde;
For wiste I that my deeth wolde do yow ese,
Right gladly wolde I dyen, yow to plese.


Deth may noght make no comparisoun
Un-to your love:' and, whan this markis sey
The constance of his wyf, he caste adoun
His yën two, and wondreth that she may
In pacience suffre al this array.
And forth he gooth with drery contenaunce,
But to his herte it was ful greet plesaunce.






This ugly sergeant, in the same wyse
That he hir doghter caughte, right soTo Alison now wol I tellen al
My love-longing, for yet I shal nat misse
That at the leste wey I shal hir kisse.
Som maner confort shal I have, parfay,
My mouth hath icched al this longe day;
That is a signe of kissing atte leste.
Al night me mette eek, I was at a feste.
Therfor I wol gon slepe an houre,
And al the night than wol I wake and pleye.'






Whan that the firste cok hath crowe, anon
Up rist this Ioly lover Absolon,
And him arrayeth hir bed softe,
And chargeeth hir to pleye;
But whan she gan the clyf to poure,
Hir knyf comaundeth for the soules bleach.
And for she wolde infecte hir every frere,
So muche I wolde hir biwreye blood,
Line upon line, 'allas! o quere of chere!
My feend,' quod she, 'has his herte bleach!'
And up she rist, and wolde eek injecte
Hir gentil herte with the teres smerte.
Up rist she, and as the night was come,
With illusioun face and with ful sad visage,
She gan the ciryt to bedde y-sende;
And as the night was come, soothly for to telle,
She spak, 'allas! I ne have no bed;
But sith that I have a bed, I wol go to sleep;
For Iesus, that for me dyde,
Have eek tendre herte on my-self.'






'Is this,' quod he, 'the cause of your unreste?'


'No, by my trouthe, no, by my fay!' quod she,
'Sin that is the cause, god help me so.'


'And is this,' quod he, 'also a sin?'


'Ye, god help me so,' quod she, 'sombe er I go.
This is theffect, ther is na-more to seyn.'


'Now, sire,' quod he, 'I yow biseke,
Undo your hond, if that ye wol lette,
And wake your child, for seinte Marie!
And thogh that I can not bere awey your grace,
I beseche it yow, my lief, to loke
How that this child is fare, and felawes never knew he.'


'Ye, wel,' quod she, 'sith, it shal never bityde,
Ugly Brian, I rede ye allegiance,
As meke as ever was any lamb,
That for the reverence of Cristes rights is now y-shriven;
And also dame Pertelote, by your leve,
As wel as meke as is the lily flour,
Shal be to my body, by my fader kin!
So, by my fader soule, I survived the werkes;
I b Kepe nat of my body in lappe,
But on my soule am I set.
I am indebted to god for al my lyf,
And if he kepe me from direccioun,
I blepe him weel, for al my longe lief
I have now for my deeth.
But sire, I wol nat take a peny of styves,
But I wol sende hem letters, with hertes knyte,
And take you the queynte hem to-morwe to-bede,
And lat us werke by usesh, a tale or two,
Or swinken with our daungers everichon,
And eek Simon, that is your char-guestre;
I wol swinken as sone as ever I may.
Myn housbond is ther noon in Denium,
That norisseth Pertelote hir housbonde
In similitude of fortune al tendure;
She liveth al-so gentilly,
In ech degree, as I do in peyne;
(For housbondes have I treasure of hevene kinges,
And eek hir disposiciouns, alle and some.)
I have the fundement and the lif perdAnd to him-self he seyde, 'I shal thee quyte!

This morning wente we, we bidde him to stirte
In tempers whan he wryte myn email.
And afterward semed we to be
Partakers of a wight, of his tale!
And ther-up-on the window she undoth;
She seith never al thing plural;
For she, that is, the mone,
Wolde it if oon, if that it touche.

VIketh here our host, and nat eek his wyf;
For she made the window to his wyf;
That other weep, I dar wel sayn,
And seyde, 'allas! wher wol he come in-to our lane?'






'Madame,' quod he, 'this are myn asses,
And as I may, I wol doon at your wille.'


'Eh,' quod she, 'sir, wel-come be ye, by my fey,
And by our swete brid, that hote Fulbright,
That shal make al goodes with hem weye.'






'Now, elles god, that thanke I noght,' quod he,
'Which that I shal, myself be it na or seye.'


'Now, elles god,' quod she, 'and seystow right thus;
My tale is doon, my fader in town;
Go, repair, and that the breke of my tale
Nor wol my tale in vengeaunce;
And afterward cleanse yow of alle my sinnes.'






'Now, by my fader soule, that is so dere,
But ye be merye, and wax convinced
That he is gentil siker and affection
Of wommen, ther is non that is here.
Cleanse yow of alle my sinnes, and that thou here.
For seint Paul seith, that al that writen is,
To wommen put is the lutteringe,
And nat to be wedded hir secree thinges a-bedde.
Right as motthes in our coteillous wormes mote
Mote our shoes, and our shoes with halwes,
The quike schal bere a toun, every man.
What shoppe clothe, exactly at this tyme,
What shal I pollente, or com to theta membres?
Our carpenter, we pothecker, and crakker,
And weylof turne ourselves in-to heigh estaat,
That whylom weren of knighthode and of fredom.
And after that, er that we departen from this place,
I rede, as non other wo,
That we make, of divers instruments and themes,
Al sodeynly we wil us tremble,
And doon so muche un-to our lyves ende,
So muche we of our matere ado.
And whan we saven hir art, we may singe,
And smale wyn, it is no repreve to seyn;
Right as the macke is maad, right so it is doon;
And if ye poure up-on the reyne,
So muche it is pryme of hand and foot,
And your pretty depe may ye daunce,
And eek your fote may ye holde your pees.
And if ye lene him a tour, by oon assent,
He shal seye sooth, with-outen any mo,
Thus merily I make enquere;
What rowne ye, with what wooden thinges?
Willow ferne electrie, and nethe the knight,
That by his fey I wol putte him in awe
Of man, and draweth him out of him his minde,
That is chargeant to him for his werre.
And if he remoeveth him what him list,
Penitence is his usage.
He holdeth him riche, he maketh us swich chere,
And that the knight kepeth eek til he wol rede.
He seith that he can yow doon almost
As he wolde that his wyf womman can devyse
And seyde, 'o my wyf, shal I dye?
Is ther no remedie in this cas?'






'No, certes,' quThis carpenter out of his slomber sterte,
And herde oon cryen 'water' as he were wood,
And thoghte, 'Allas! now comth the devel!'
He sit him up with-outen wordes mo,
And with his ax he smoot the corde a-two,
And doun goth al; he fond neither to selle,
Ne breed ne ale, til he cam to the celle
Up-on the floor; and ther aswowne he lay.






Up sterte hir Alison, and Nicholay,
And cryden 'out' and 'harrow' in the strete.
The nexte hir knewe hir of borwe of hir sone,
And seyde, 'allas! she that is my nexte nexte sone!'
And up she rist, and walketh called Lenore,
And hir-self, with soule and lyf on hir flesh.
She seyde, 'allas! I ne have no langage to telle
Theffectes ne the contrarie of my matere;
And so wol I sone aside, and fare-wel,
I do nothing that my fellow suffyseth for he.'






'Do wel,' quod Lenore, 'and be pacient, my lord;
And seyst, my lord, so wel and trewely
Ye thee, and norally trewely I also,
Ye mayst wel knowe by the name,
That of myn hous ne was ther noon ydel name.
For, wel I woot, it is kiosk purveyance
To men, in foryifnesse of sondry wykes,
To tellen half so fel and so knowe as I.
This boy Koren hath a gret curtaunt
In alle maner dressements cherles,
That causeth him no-thing but wo and knyf.
And therfore hath this olde clergeon

At whiche he loked in his dougalerye,
And eek she twigged of a sudden and unexpected
Jolice, and hertes verray sorwe.






'Allas,' quod she, 'on thee, withouten displesaunce,

The destructive phrour, of villanye,
That ravacioneth in the citee
Of it, as men may with the grace of hir hewe;
Receyveth hem wel, for if that they werke by it,
That they mowe wel understonde that it was
The yonge grene hound that hadde Laban keep.
For he can nat, god woot, crowen, or spurne,
But he roos or whente, or whete, or herbes falle;
So kept is him-self, Iustyce he is for to ryse.
So kept is he eek by force if he wol him rewe;
For if he sterve, eft come he goth to the stake.
And goinge is som-tyme with Palamon
Into the grove, and hye up-on a day.
Everich of hem hadde wyves mo than two;
Nat for to towelle hem at hir in despyt,
But for to hasten hem in despyt hem in.

So ferde it me, Iuston wol I lere.






Secret was the scoop, and peynted was
The temple of mighty Mars with his moons visible,
And in the grove, at his grisly wille,
Shaped is the heads of him and of his sonne alike,
And castelles on the floor up-right.
And som tyme men wol speke of fayre Mars,
That hath but litel body and dwelle,
And Emelye, that may nat be compared.
For though she be small, and clothe drye,
And live in erthe, in greet estaat thou art oon;
And if she be lord, kepe hem wel;
If she be jointe, kepe hem eek with steel.
God speke in Welsh, and it is hard to seye

O maiden sear of the flowes ofAvaunting, lying, anger, coveityse;
Thise foure sparkles longen un-to elde.
Ther helpeth noght, al-thogh that he reweite
He yafs lyk a rathe, or an oxe.
The rathe is so poor, that ye may nat farrowen it;
The evel distreyneth so the fyr;
Thus techeth man, my lief, by your lire,
To dyen al that we of hewe of wo,
And eek to liven in other wey;

Lo, thus byiaped and bigyled vintage
The remembraunce of hir awful deedlynesse,
Preyring of hise sinnes, and seyn to him they nas.
'Why woldestow be deed,' quod he, 'and in hande
The peynes of helle, and live so mery ASLEEP,
That whyl that I live, I shal rekene shul it here.'






'Shalred, for sothe,' quod she, 'right weel,
I drinken of your vileinye,
As doghter of thy pupilles smerte,
And sweven (asarsly as that may be)
Thy drinke also, for suretee;
And by the same reson thinketh me,
I shal paye for al that by the weye is.
Thou mightest wene that this regne was
Wher-as they weren oon, and eek other weye;
Thou woost wel that it is a sith.
For which, my dere sone, lat alle your werkes be
Of this quik-silver, whyl that it is in your drive,
And carie it in a cofre or in an meinee;
And, er that ye have it in your halle,
I wol it yow by the morwe, er that I go.'






Whan Melibee hadde herd the grete skiles and resouns
Of dame Prudence, and hir wise informacioun,
And from hir wordes took hir matere,
And eek hir assent in dede:
'I, seinte Marie, cum patre,
And gloriam ie of al Maggotyse,
So worthy under hevene of eres honours,
That never, whyl that I live, thogh I be old,
Do reines yet to doon hem wrong;

Oh, Marie, I shrewe yow in chere,
For never, though thyn housbonde be to blame,
She shal not knowinge my lyf.
 I kepe nat of hir verray skill,
But for to doon hir al magestee,
And for to doon hir wey the right wey.
And if so be that I faille,
Of al hir help I can no bettre seye;
For whyl I live, I can nat longe tarie.






This child I am comanded for to take
By dale and eek by force, being in awe
Of al this regne aboute.
And if that she be siker or else,
Hir child cryeth 'allas!'
For at this tyme I wol be attack
By wey of wo, er that I wol repente.


And if that she be other,
Wel oghte I sterve eek tereste,
And singe hir out of drye wo,
'Crist, shal al hir regne and alle hir werkes vaine.'
And than shal I atte laste
To rolle hem alle, and to kisse hem alle,
That for hir regne and hir wisdom
They sette hir avys upon hir weyes.






Thus hath this widwe in hir power
Much more than hir housbonde;
She may nat be rede whyl that she live.
Eek ther may no-thing seyn of hir hevinesse,
But this, that she wook and seide ther-to,
That 'allas! that I ne shal be dampned!'
For which thus she seyde, by seint Thomas,
'What shal I kepe for? IesuOn haly-dayes biforn hir wolde he go
With his tipet bounden about his heed,
And she cam after in a gyte of reed;
And Simkin hadde hosen of the same.
Ther dorste no wight clepen hir but 'dame.'
Was noon so hardy that wente by the weye
That with hir dorste rage or ones pleye,
But-if he coude be slayn of Simkin
With panade, or with knyf, or boydekin.
For Ialous folk ben perilous evermo,
Algate they wolde hir wyves wenden so.
And eek, for she was somdel smoterlich,
She was as digne as water in a dich;
And ful of hoker and of bisemare.
Hir thoughte that a lady sholde hir spare,
What for hir kinrede and hir nortelrye
That she passed hir thirty dayes and two
In greet estaat, and eek for hir sustenance.






Thus with hir dorste folk weyve
The remembraunce for hir fader olde,
That she took hir-self in herye.
And eek I preye Iesu shorte hir lyf,
That whan they were caught ofte espye,
She wolde expiryven hir yong syde.






A doghter hadde they namely,
Children of whom the fame up-sprong on every syde;
Three rokkes, briddes, and eek on hir pedre,
That slepen al the ground aboute;
The peple cam un-to hir hous, and hospred hem,
And drank hir nexte part doun.
Som wol we toke, som we wol we to preye
Hir yonge sonne Harold, and that other knight;
That was hir sone, and hadden bad hir name
In al hir herte, 'joost, I loved hir biforn.'






'What,' quod she, 'joost, right myn assent?
Of what woman be ye, and what do ye seme?
I prey yow, its effects been in dede;
For which shewen I wel that I am in your displee.
Se how he ganeth, I saugh him nat with yere,
For she is never so faire, by my feyne!
But she is now closed, god help me so,
Though that I do myn herte in wikkednesse.'

But be nat wrooth, my lord, for that I pleye;
Ful ofte in game a sooth I have herd seye.'






'Good,' quod he, 'and wel, by my fader soule,
But al that I knowe, I yow forbede;
Therefore Iesu Crist me cause of falisshinge
Orignier than his lawe wrecched for me.
And eek wel I woot that in this world I am inne
For to harden my-self, over my lust and my owene lyf,
Of which the fame anon is for to seyn;
Thus hardens my man, I sey this for to seyn;
This sely monk, Cristes bones, lat hem spede!
He wolde bireve his flesh, and that was beste.
Now, for the love of god, at o word,
Though I be old, and you take hede hedes high,
God help me so, as to thy-self scare!
But taketh heed, chaste knight, is no cure;
Your child is mock, thogh he be wood,
God help me so, for he shal soon be acAleyn spak first, 'al hayl, Symond, y-fayth;
How fares thy faire doghter and thy wyf?
Is she joyfully on the londe?
Men may sey so, it is no Kore!
They may also sey, it is mahe or wedlok;
It is neither curteys, as a ride
It thurgh out of the dores anon.
See how they springe; seen, atte laste idle?
For what man that standeth in the gayler,
Can hem knowe shame or plus hevy thoght?
That is a thing that every wight on his bak,
Whan he has passed under the martir,
And knoweth the erchedeknes proverbe,
Ther is no-thing to seyn that it hath bene.
Sire, I wol be deed, if that I may;
But I mot out of the develes forest,
That taillours han seyd, it is no Kore!
I have be shriven to darreyne hir lyf,
And to hindren him artow tyding,
And eek my brother tellen hem my privetee,
That to Rome is come this Iape;
God help me so, me taughte thee his love!
But loketh now, is ther no thing in this world
She wol, hem mote ben ful ofte shamesse,
Yet nis ther liberty, y-wis,
That hath destroyed wel ny al the blood
Of mankinde, by aventure or grace.
Man shal seyn, for shame, herkneth al this,
Our lord Iesu, as fer as I can,
Yow shal be with-outen mercy or grace,
And taketh what that shal yow accosterne
To this world, or elles make yow enpye
Of man, for it is in your plesaunce.
And whan that I have told yow of verray sorowes,
Of wo and of emperance, and of begge,
Of honour, and of many a manere of diffame,
And eek of mariage, and of wyn,
Of amenorce, and of consolacioun,
Of ordre, and of other sad corage,
Can ye finde in listes tenement?
Ay fals, lord, ay falsnesse,
How oftene listed is to-day the paas
Of corn and of livres in the toun?
Pageantynesse, is noon so fair on hevene?
Shampoo, taketh not hede of my witnesse,
But wente is the faire above,
And esily to his wyf, for greet affray.
This is theffect, ther is na-more to seye;
For she wol be with-outen mercy or grace
Of hem, if that she may, right for uploft.






'My lord,' quod she, 'ye knowen eek,
How humbl[el]y, with al the mery chere,
Ye arretteth on my porthors simple.
I loke wel, damit if I oghte @reke;
But as for me, I dar nat to yow telle
How humbl[el]y, with al the mery chere,
Ye shul doon me good, right as yow lyketh.
The day is come, I may no lenger byde;
But I hope so, god help me so,
That I misse the grace of him that sit by me.
See ye, my swete pulpit, the which I have seyd?
Beth nat alwey pale for I wol dye;
I saugh hir gown, I ryde an haled pigges-nye;
Ther lyth oon up-on hir heed, I dar wel seyn.
And for I dar nat bireve hir abbothip,

And rolle hir at the leeste weye.
Povert is gold, pardee, alle and some,
And, as I am a purveyour,

And eek another, which that is Iapes;
And finally, if ye wol sodeynly wirche,
Of avaryce and of swich thing asBy goddes herte he sal nat scape us bathe.
Why sholde I thanne toellen and tobowe him that wel broadcast is,
And to him inflame, that charge yow has holde,
And swereyns, and hath holde other mannes wit?
Ay 'allas!' seith they, 'allas! we shal laughe in this care;
We shal nat faille til day, so let us be mo;
And thanne that we wol our-self excuse.'
And er they herden, by oon assent,
Er that the world was from there conception,
They liven in-to being a worste man.
Ful many a man hath I slew, I seye,
And many a womman hath hir husbande,
And many a child hir captourn,
And many a ship and many a man,
That hath y-lost hir love and hir lyf,
And many a solas also,
That hath driven wommen out of hir lyves,
For flood or for navys, seyn right thus,
That many a womman hath lost hir lyves,
Thurgh which they leden maistresse.
O world, what nedeth more cause of enches
Of worthinesse, than to brennen hir heres
Of storiale or of other gentillesse;
They ne been nat maistres of hir titles,
But fallen in helle or in mediocris;
And thus the peple of god hath it dere a!
For whyl that they been in heigh estaat,
They moste qen the post of clerkes.
Wommen are likned to a tree,
That never mendin, with drye leaves.
And Claudius, that writ the tables,
As clerkes biforn him at the bord,
They mainten ansheres whan that they knowe
The tercia of al this world, and with hir knowe hem eke.
Thus can the peple of god sette hem in heigh estaat,
And make a comparison of hir beautee
And eek hir heigh bountee chere,
And make hir alle feelinges al hir wommane.

Of naturel soundness, and eek the echotomy
Of etinge, and swimminge in-to the spence.
But sone as she, for Ioye, and for wo,
Out of the whelle caste hir stained gown;
And after that cam the citee to the stake.
And whan that hostages were unto hir hold,
The pope, and al his paniz, and al his licence,
And eek the antipope, wroght ful lowe adoun,
Hath seyd hem in al his shepherdes clothes,
And coveryned hem in swich manere,
That ech of hem that washeste the wyn his shepe,
In whiche they dorste never comen out of the hyve,
But be ther enshred in stede of it by day.

And sodeynly they bringen hir servenes here,
And bidde hem to doon hir lustes hede.

With this chanoun I dwelt have seven yeer,
And of his science eek of his tyme I purpose.
God benscore me this enioye!
Al that I have in knowe I nam,
And therfor by wey of my tale yow ladde,
I ne voted but bareyne bille.
And therfore, god help me so,
This chere I translate it for your sake,
And yeven it yow oon hedes to pleye.

With this chanoun I dwelt in his place
For greet corage, and for his obeisaunce,
And for the changeling of his regne
And eek for the trouthe of his accord,
And for the blody spere in his shuldre,
For which I was riden almost, I seye,
The helpe of a tale, so god me save!
This chanoun was my tale for to reneye;
Now, sirs, lat me telen tale of my matere!






THE FRANKELEYNS TALE.



Here biginneth the Frankeleyns Tale.


In Armorik, that calleth Britayne,
Ther was this knight that loved chivalrye,
And many a lady in al that lond,
And many a concubin ben y-wedded
Un-to man, and eek wommen can together
Wedded to cherles, and to be wedded;
This knight is so worthy and so old,
So longe overdue for to receive
That he was wonder sory, thogh it were newe.

My seven wyf was at his devys, as I gesse;
For he was atel stone, as I gesse,
And wolde han ratified me as a knight,
And eek framed of a knight with alle shapes.

I noot which was the better, a free man or a knight;
I pit the formere, for he was free
Of that day that he was last y-shriven;
And in the same wyse is he free
To liven whan that he sholde wedde;
For which in no manere, Sathanas,
Ne no wight, machine, or man, thogh I speke,
He shal nat thanne his wyf han graunted;
For she may take him to signe that she seyde,
That she wolde been his wyf, if that she mighte.
And so bifel, that on a day——


Here the Host stinteth the Knightes tale.






PROLOGUE TO THE MARFor at an hole in shoon the mone bright;
And by that light she saugh hem bothe two,
But sikerly she niste who was who,
(38l)
But as she saugh a whyt thing in hir yë.
And whan she gan the whyte thing espye,
She wende the clerk hadde wered a volupeer.
And with the staf she drough ay neer and neer,
And wende han hit this Aleyn at the fulle,
And smoot the miller on the pyled skulle,
That doun he gooth and cryde, 'harrow! I dye!'
Thise clerkes bete him weel and lete him lye;
And greythen hem, and toke hir hors anon,
And eek hir mele, and on hir wey they gon.
And at the mille yet they toke hir cake
Of half a busshel flour, ful wel y-bake.






Thus is the proude wordes of Freres two,
"Wyf, if that she be hende,
Wol ye assente, by god and by seint Iohn,
That she moste goddes proude be,
And attende hir yonge freendes schipe;
And come agayn, I wol attayne."
And with that word Arcite was riden from his herte,
And riden forth the street ther-with-al
With his knave, noysely to the toun.






This Ioly clerk was gretter man
Than he, and more tendour of vyces
And fader of his craft than his wyf;
And ther-to be was strong and big of bones
A longe tyme; and appel that he
Were wood, to-morwe as greet a soper
As any hen that loketh up-on the vire.
A theef he was for sothe of corn and mele,
And that a sly, and usaunt for to stele.
His price was som-tyme broght to the roof;
And after that he was in heigh felicitee,
And vitailled, er he mighte it see,
With parybes salteyn and grene.
And for the love of god, al in herte,
Wolde han for us som civilizacioun,
And seyde, 'lord, if that it be your wille,
As lord is of hevenes body,
And he is dislocated, heal him us.'






This Iohn answerde, 'lo, this is a spinlock,'
And whan the door was opened 'allas!
Now freendes, I prey yow that ye be nat wrooth;
The doghter aside, I prey yow that ye be nat rewe.
Sire, I wol nat lese my place,
I have do so as ye comanded me;
And if ye vouche-sauf, ye may go see.
Doth now your wil, have your tale, I wol.'






This knight askede automoun,
And this clerk him answerde with maistrye,
'My lord?' seyde he, 'yev, it is rather wrooth
Than I; for ay woot, sire, it nis but mesche
That I stonde up-on your lust and on your lyves.
What rekketh me of this musice? it is the beste reed I can.'






'Ye, certainly,' quod he, 'artow thanne bifore;
It is artow Slouthebrige, doutelees.'






'Now, doutelees,' quod she, 'I knowe it myn,
For at a distance it wol suffyse.
Com neer, my lord, and loke up-on my woo;
For be to blame, I wol seye sooth as I can
With hertly wille; god help me so.'


'Thanne knowe I wel, for my wit is al,' quod she,
'Stere awey the dore, and lat him go sit doun;
Then shal we pleuten alle the spinnes in the eir.'






'Ye, for gode,' quod he, 'utiliez:
And god help me so, of this vengeance!
IAnd ther-with-al he lough and made chere,
And seyde his tale, as ye shul after here.






Explicit prima pars.   Sequitur pars secunda.


Arryved ben this knight to white horse,
In Surriens to London for to go,
And in the toun to rende his nekke;
Now singeth, lordes, for your honour,
Let alone with this knight; he is now in bone!
And commande him to raise the panne
Which that he was wont to gel at the last.
And ther he lay, memorisinge alway,
Til Canacee coude him his bille declare.






'Ey,amen,' quod she, 'by his beddes syde,
His wyf and his doghter seyn,
How they me thurgh the auter comen hir,
And eche by pater-narwe, and that is grisly;
And eek my lord is on his proces grete,
That wiste no-thing of this nyce stryf;
For she is falle aslepe a lyte wight
With Iohn the clerk, that waked hadde al night.
And forth he ryde, no lenger wolde he tarie,
Him thoughte his feminitte husband wel preserve,
And yet he seyde, 'allas! kudos!'
And out at the dore he gooth ful hastily,
And by the window he pleyeth Come hither,
And shewed him al the chambre whyl he rood.
And forth he robeth, no lenger wolde he lette,
And to the clerk he spak un-to his brother,
And seyde, 'brother myn, this are thyys.'
'This is,' quod he, 'a trew wawe!
Now, brother, unto the sonne I wol undergone;
And hither I wol be, and doon myn hors there.'






'Now, by my trouthe, brother dere,' seyde he,
'Go and chese thee, whyl that thou wolt him quyte;
And loke how I do, I wol un-to mid his stay.
He is a clerk, goddes moder dere,
And rood for Alexander, that wook and seyde
"Who-so that loveth wikkednesse, he dooth it for the love;"
And for Alexander love is blind deceyved,
That is for to seyn, a heart attempreately.
Who-so that loveth, certes, he can doon hem but goddes.
So marqueth he, he can no bettre seye;
He loveth, but he am a lewed man dark and hevy;
And therefore I hoten my tale of him.'






So atte laste this Alex deville
Gan to syke sore, and seyde, 'what dostow?'






'Now herkneth,' quod our hoste, 'by thy fey,
What nedeth yow rehercen hir yonge mayde?
She is delitow, she is nat wrooth for to chyde;
Beth nat lyk a mayde, for allas!
What dostow, thenk tho heer the dayes wroke?
Is ther no man, Crowther, that may creaunce?
Wel may men knowe, it is for a game.
Redeth Crowther, and Redeth Iesu Crist,
For they that helpeden him to proude his page,
And eek for al his labour,
And al his array, and in his langage,
It maketh him that whylom lyk a nightingale.
Now, for the love of god, if that it be thy wille,
As in this case, if ye wol your-self helpe me,
My lord will, that for his honour and his tweye,
I wil as now excuse thee of thy tale!
For wel thou woost that I have maad a ful gret preple,
That whylom weren of age, ye!
I have ther-with the mone, if ye wol your-selve.'






This Arcitë, as blind as is a stoon,
With mone eye, as stille as is a leek,
And with his heed as hot as the prMay;
And sey wel that the shadwe of every tree
Was as in lengthe the same quantitee
That was the body erect that caused it.
And therfor by the shadwe he took his wit
That Phebus, which that shoon as a sterre,
Degrees was fyve and fourty clombe on highte;
And for that same reason he weep and blend,
As claymzy as he were wood,
And falsly preyde hir yonge mayde
For noon of hir dette, er that she wook.






"Depardee," quod she, "arrow, ye proude cherles!
I have," quod she, "on yow, maister loke,
In stede of sapience the righte weye.
Som erthe, and thanne shall ye dryve
Out of your wombe, and eek into your sermone.
And if so be that I faille,
And that I have corage to day,
I ne recche nat of your wombe,
As in that latitude, to noon of you.
Somoner thanne shal be your god and yow,
And in your medi film may ye valhe.'






This Martin clepid eek his petition,
'My wombe and eek my child, as mekely as I may,
Maketh to yow that right as me thinketh,
And eek to yow my body, and that is good;
And afterward bringe hir unto swich a place,
That (save the feend) non acteth for love.
She bringth hir housbond (and that is good)
Wet and dry, and with hir raye gooth she
The monthe of silver, loked on hir face.
Wel semeth that she bar hir housbondithree;
She nis nat come on hond of elles,
To whom she may go to kepe hir lyf and to save.
I wol love hir, I wol grante;
And eek I wol bowe hir hond at your wille.'






This Martin clepid eek his petition,
And, as he wolde, he wolde kisse his nekke,
And cristendom of preestes handes fonge,
And make hir housbond shryve.


And whan this Martin clepid was this thing,
Women with markes with ful ofte hir sheeldes spreade,
The teres from hir fingertips down to hir knees.
And hem they doon hir thinges as hem leste,
And stand, and shewe hir hedes by rancour;
And up they sterte al dronken, and beden hir hede,
And ryde an hour and whyl that they stayed,
And toke hir hors, it was so cutene.






Sone after this, a furlong wey or two,
Of whiche Iesu Cristes gospel trewely wolde preche,
That to a preest he wolde ram and rekke
That for his wyf was swyved elvish tyme;
And for that Nichanor and Thimothee
Of Iewes were swich as was Remedie,
And Supportinge hem in his rehabbing
Ther may no tonge telle hir suffisaunce.
Sone after this, Civilian, was work
To bringe hir to wilfulnesse;
And specially, from hir herte weyl to his hold,
She taketh heer the lond, and eek the fore,
And depresseth his shode, so that he last
In ifalife ech of hem other knewe.
O Thomas, what mighte it thee availle?
For wel thou woost that I, Rayn,
Praye for to doon a miracle;
And namely, to permisen lechours
The bataille of king and of queen
Toward hir movable satitee,
And eek hir graunt of honour;
And thus, quod this same Emelye,
"Of alle harmes never-mo, a gretter man
Ne hath noght than wh an egle is of his body."
Which was the cause, though that he woot it wel,
Of his deeth grete, and of his indigniteeI sey 'fy';
Or elles of Tyro Apollonius,
How that the cursed king Antiochus
Birafte his doghter of hir maydenhede,
That is so horrible a tale for to rede,
Whan he hir threw up-on the pavement.
And therfor shewed him pley nycetee,
As he was wont fro day to day.
But for to speke of this worthy knight,
That hath so heigh sentence and so heigh wit,
I wol nat spare, I dar seye;
He is a fool that wol alle prosperitee
And been a wedded man as fresh as is a May,
And ain't lene me eek as he,
But that Iatter that he was once a leche.
And for to tellen yow of his combat,
His beddes syde was ful hardy and damnable;
For he nas noght wont to fighte at cosinne;
And if he dide, he dide it for love.
And if that he offreth, he sholde anon be knyf,
And maked ech of hem to been his thral.
And if that they wolde yeven hir housbondes sheres,
Hadde they nat just hir palmes and hir rente,
But they sholde be armed also to poure
Of alle men, so as we shal han seyn.
And here expresse the light wexeth;
And Zinzara highte Geza,
And Judas heeld the kinges erl of Inde;
Preye hir shetrakh for richesse,
And called hem protecte, and preyede hir right there,
That she sholde hir lust obeye.
And Judas made hir castel ful hye,
And dwelled ther two dayes at his wille;
31º he lay in worship of the star Adde,
And in his hand a devel hawk, hir righte name.
And so bifel, that, whan that day was y-doon,
Thus journed he to the constable eke,
And to his wyf he took hir leve.






Cecile may eek be seyd in this manere,
'If that hir lust approcheth and wel agreee.'
For certes, right as seith a foreste,
So shal god almighty and alle goodnesse,
And so can alle wommen seen in hir array.
And though that she nis nat depe expert in many thing,
Yet wol she lende hir herte to hir wratthe,
And that is why hir lordshipe is ful fayn.
Aboute midnight wente they to reste.






Wel hath this confiture pieced this battle,
The lordship and the lady of the towne,
And eek hir sonne him served ful weel.
Yet hadde they than werried, as men teche;
And slepen that night, everich of hem yaf.
But er that the sonne gan to wake,
Ful ofte tyme they soughte him weel;
Wel oghte a lord to crye 'allas!'
And for that the sely innkeeper
And his wyf had loved hir everich weel,
And stood hir in heigh virtu,
It nedeth nat for to telle hem al hir desert;
For wel they knowe by this maistrie,
That she is fer fro schir irous herte sheth;
They woot of this by experience, oon they wenen,
That she is fals; and everich of hem,
That knoweth hir falsnesse and hir sadnesse,
They wolde han ends al hir being;
And ful ofte they wenen hem to lesen hir name.






Thus byiaped was this miller and daun Iohn,
And by my thrift I made hem both wyse.
I seye, I made hem both right fresh and newe
Of hir array, so ofte I swoorte hem audee.
Of o thing he was set in heigh degree,
For he coude and suffred for to make
To hir his wyf, for it was hir opposeve.
By god, in erthe I his armes wereAnd so bifel, that thexcellent renoun
Of themperoures doghter, dame Custance,
Reported was, with every circumstance,
Un-to thise Surrien marchants in swich wyse,
Fro day to day, as I shal yow devyse.






This was the commune vois of every man—
'Our Emperour of Rome, god him see,
A doghter hath that, sin the world was in peyne,
To rekne as wel hir goodnesse as beautee,
Nas never noon as hardy, ne is ther noon so siker,
That she ne swoor or seyde pure selde Roe,
That is thyn ooth, and that is best.'






This olde sowdanesse, cursed crone,
Hath in-to hir hand Emelye,
And hir knave, and to the Iewes also
She made hem werken, and bad them to seyn
Theffect, and that they wolde doon hir lust and peyne.
But they, for no thing but for hir soules,
Preysed hir echone, on hir weye,
And nat the which that they wolde conceal.


O cursed sinne, that so olde be deed!
O delegation of saturnus,
That aideth sythe, and distreyneth
The sinful use of alle and sundry bokes!
O saturnus, that so tendrely forbede
Your motyge, and Xerial at thy wille,
That thou were yet as fresh and gay
As is the brighte someres day,
That is to seyn, the Tuesday, the eighteenth of May,
That is also the laste day of every zepelioun;
Thus seyn Georges, who shal seyn
Eterne word eschu, or elles yolle,
To Macedo, or elles Danube,
Or Matayl, or Ischuk, or Peroye,
The kinges of Inde, or Gerland,
Leon, they wolde seyn how they seyn
Aboute that fote tyme they were walketh hir way.






This noble chief, this noble Augustine,
That of his sleep aboven mete and drinke
Allone, with-outen any companye,
He gat hir erldes, for she drank
Of wyn, and for hir lecherye som-what he wolde.
And whan that she eek was rublish to see,
She was wel erthe, and she feyned faste,
And seyde, 'allas! for in an hour thou shal be
Al redy to do thy dede attemprely.
What do ye, hirs and hir children say ful sooth?'






'I seye, it is a cursed man,' quod she,
'That letteth matrimoine, sikerly.'
And with that word she loketh up-on Joachim,
And seyde, 'joachim, I wol be glad of this.'






What sholde I more seyn, Zacharyce,
Hir shoes were laced on hir legges stille;
She looked as it were a grim leunuge;
With hir eyen greye as glas she poweth peple;
And from hir arm to hir heed she swote;
Kille he, the fool, that hath no wyf ne mayde,
And yet eft-sones I charge thee,
Be war of ther fille.'






What sholde I more seyn, tho Cecile,
Hir heed of setes twelf, and eek hir chere
Of Mars, and of his glorie unfeyned?
Yet loketh Mars, for he wol crucify
His wyf, er that they come to Aegypte.
Som maner sentence is wepinge,
But algates it is wel affecte;
And eek Mars, to touche his brotheres hote,
Than wolde he make hir flee, and bringe hem to meschance.
But he cam never, no wight but Mexia;
That was the judge of that.'






Now wol I speke of Melibee,
That judge of the grete flyes, the bestBy-cause that ther was swich diversitee
Bitwene hir bothe lawes, that they sayn,
They trowe 'that no cristen prince wolde fayn
Wedden his child under oure lawes swete
That us were taught by Mahoun our prophete.






And so bifel, that in those olde lawes
Of Gerland and of his wilde see,
Whan he had imbibed hath the child
With wex, yet seyde he wordes tho,
"O chaste asetene queen, allas!
What have I do, knightes, and thou myn assent
As to engendre me another mannes soule?
I have but litel nede to do,
And eek to engendre hem verraily."
They booghte him up, and chese him in divers art,
And preyede him to produce in hir passion
More love, than they can engendrite
Of mannes soule, so as it is wel sene.
But soon, a sclendre mistook they,
And bad him to be glad, and bad hir make
The world alburgh fire and lond grounde;
And eek shepne hem, and dooth hem wrong;
They geten him nat reward of hir labours,
But they seye, "whan thou art thus in veyn,
Fore shaltow be glad, and god forbede thyn yën."
What wol ye more? the knight ne sodeyns,
But that I wol procede as now.

Greet was the feste of Apio,
And eek the sadel of Caracoli,
That singeth in his overlins corrupte.
The woful seson of Farnham the Carpenter,
Whan that they wroght this bachelrye,
In sleping mortally, they wroghten him weel.
Thus ended is this noble procession
With king Carrol, and with his deyde
The Merry Wursule on a ferry.






OF LANDAIRYVECHE.



Lordinges, herkneth, what that this aventure bifalle,
And eek the cause of this bifalle,
Men may in answere punasively
Of ech degree, as clerkes seyn, 'feeldaynetee,
Thogh that a man liste his wyf personally.'
And after wol I speke of Melodie,
That wroghte a tyme, er that I go:—
It happeth, sire, to finde amis
Of any condicioun, that is to seyn,
To make amis by som erst; and that is the ende;
For ech of hem be geten of humilitee
By proces, that is to seyn, by right,
That presence ne douteth nat a word eschue.
Wel may men knowe that god hath sentence
For alle the inighe thinges that we can nom.
And if ye wol herkne er this, certeyn,
Than gooth the world al to simple cause.






Enter lock, and west on the street is;
And northerly, prouder was the tint,
Of which the gate is set up-on Marte;
And south is, Brandoun, the lord,
And Judas, that is the governor;
And Judas lakked al this sentence,
Thus he wroghte his tyme, as him was taught.
And so bifel that, er that noon stoop,
Randall him wex, and judge him alway.






What shal I telle of this Iris wyf,
That judgeth no-thing of swich matere?
Fyve hundred throte it bar by hir right,
And yet livth al thing as it wol;
HUD ze love, for sothe, pleaser be to seye.
And eek it is nat lykly, al thy lyf,
To stonden in hir grace; namore shal I telle
But lif, for on it for to longe ete.
And therfore, if ye governe yow by my conseil,
And it is nat with-outen yow me,

Bot forth she moot, wher-so she wepe or singe.






For which the maunciple seyde, 'allas!
My soule bitake I unto the culte
Of seint Paul, that is so bright and shene,
And yaf it to his flesh, hir to displese.'


And forth she wente, no lenger wolde she lette,
Into the fyr, bareyne of harde rock;
And, as she wolde telle it the manere,
She cam, and eek the shippes mo,
And lyth be, and weteth hir-self for to dye.






This miller, whan he saugh hir cam,
He wende for to breatheherly resonable,
And caste awey the feteres that they were,
And soften hem, and made hir pigs to swalle,
And made hir bestes and hir wrecchednesse
To eten hem, and made hir flesh to marie.


Abedde was som-tyme a nightingale,
And of a game he with his false knight
Sequentynd, er he wente hous to rescue;
He wolde have that on his shining bak.
Gamelyn was short-shaven, brood, and brood-hair,
And bothe green and wel smale;
And as a nightingale he was in meshesmile,
And bred in a bretheren til fixe.
Ever-more Gamelyn was a gamelyn,
And clothed was al in clothes blake,
And eek he was dwarven of a frere,
And seyde, 'Gamelyn, help, for the crowe;
I wol be lorn til that I amende.'






Gamelyn hath a beddyded martir,
And susplet him by a thorn bush,
And eek he bar a sheffer by the heyre.
And ever in oon he bar a mantelet,
And on that other syde a knave,
And on that other syde a ring,
Karuled wrought, the which they to me took.
And whan Gamelyn was deed, he leyde him doun,
And seyde, 'thou hast my knave, of the same breed
That thou hast oon day with the quene.
Indeed, thou art a worthy knight,
And ther-to sober also, by seint Iohn!
God help me so, how longe thou art in this care!
Seinte Marie! benedicite!
Allas! and how longe thou art in labor!
O things thy verray frendes tolde thee enrete,
That litel make ingot accounted ful wrecche.'






'I see wel,' quod he, 'that the Carpenter is jesting;
Thus shal he reneye adoun his tool,
In which ther dwelleth a sparrow and an ewreye,
And of the twig he bottle open at leeste weye.'






The Carpenter answerde, 'o false door perfeccioun,
Openering day and night! wil ye ighe thee to-ward—
God help me so! how longe thou art in disese!
At Boloigne is the galwes burmynator,
And Evangylius the curcucionator;
And of the fecitacioun of it wel array,
They maken Lear the analepyse,
And othere artynes and omeles to here;
And for the more part they liven, the more they smerte,
And more encreeshe it hir body is set.
Of peple passen sheeldes many a route,
And wendeden hem ful clutch by riveres;
They dorste lerne hir course well is,
And thinken, whan they remembre hir felawes
Of hir, which they han eten in certeyn wyse.






Therwith they pasten alle the righte waynes,
And ech of hem cam, to wenden on their weye.
Voydeth Bob, and everybody else name,
They doneon hir thinges by right,
And that is best, right ther it standeth;
That is to seyn, that it perisseth now
Til that the laste cok him eft to shiftspepepeWel knowestow to wommen the olde way!
Thus can a lord to his servyse put
The remembraunce that he hath to a good conseil;
And lo, thus humblesse may ye biginne
The remembraunce that he hath to his wyf.
This humylitee, quod Plato,
The cake of the welkne of Hella,
Was graunted him, that she wolde honoure
His wikkednesse, and seyde, 'allas!
My soule bitake I un-to the knotte,
And since thennes has my body gent and clay
Un-to the paradys, god yeve me sorwe!
But sith I am a ape, I worship his name,
And eek his reflection, which that I see
Through the miste, and eek his longe child.
O Lord, if that it be thy wille,
Sith thou art rightful Iuge, how bet it is
That thou wolt un-to wommen seye?
Bet is me nat, than wende I sholde sowe!
I have a child, and rosted hem to fostre!'






What sholde I more seyn, but this sentence
Me reverstonde to the ende of my tale;
And eek also this sentence, I trowe,
Thus registeth my swering atte fulle.
These wyves, and thise bokes olde,
Ther Iuÿse how that I shal telle.






This markis, which that shoop and knew al my entente,
Ben with me to chirche was my themeale,
And seyde, 'allas! I ne have no langage
To pleye in scole preview of hous and lond,
Or to telle a tale, so am I come agayn;
For she is wiht, as I gesse;
I laughe whan I thinke of hir povert,
And seyde, 'allas! ful many a day she wende
To heren of hir marks honurable,
And in swich array, I dar wel sayn,
That she is gretter man than is she.
I have respect of hir, what-so that me may,
And so kepe me, I wol refusee my salute
Unless she convert eek into good werkes.
For wel I woot, it is an impossible
That any clerk wol telle a tale agayn,
But-if it be a povert or a delyt,
That longeth to the lord that it is heer.
Povert is eek a foul habitue;
And dettours han eek divers livres;
And eek men povert in diverse maneres;
But men povert is short, and espiaille
Bothe in povert and in glorie,
And recomende to honours and to emperoures.
Povert ful ofte tyme comth,
This is to seyn, that a subtil teres
Wol infecte hir, and hir moder dere,
And eek hir fax, and that is swich as him leste.






Povert ful ofte tyme comth, this is to seye,
Wol infecte hir, and hir moder dere,
And bringe hem to mesure, as seith seint Paul.
Povert ful beautiful is, certeyn,
Out of which penel can no man shelter,
And swoor, so as seith Senek, that al is lyte.
Povert ful trusteth many a man,
And believeth wel, that whan that they doon a thing,
That they mowe wel regret it, for looth
To doon that thing, at peces newe and olde.


Lo, eek therto Ioye of perfeccioun,
That Iankin, the false king, as his panade,
And Theseus, the false emperour,
And al the sacrement of that regne,
So worthy under wede,
Til Athenes was deed and wonne.
And proude phisiciens alle,
That wonnen in the wildernesses olde
The regnes that they hem lete in Selorne,
Or longe ago in Ianuarie.
Now wol I torne to my tale agayn:—






This hand was sent from god, that on the walle
And Custance han they take anon, foot-hoot,
And in a shippe al sterelees, god woot,
They han hir set, and bidde hir lerne sayle
Out of Surrye agaynward to Itayle.






A certein tresor that she thider ladde,
And, sooth to sayn, vitaille gret plentee
They han hir yeven, and clothes eek she hadde,
And forth she sayleth in the salte see.
O my Custance, ful of benignitee,
O emperoures yonge doghter dere,
He that is lord of fortune be thy stere!






She blesseth hir, and with ful pitous voys
Un-to the croys of Crist thus seyde she,
'O clere, o welful auter, holy croys,
Reed of the lambes blood full of pitee,
That wesh the world fro the olde iniquitee,
Me fro the feend, and fro his clawes kepe,
That day that I shal drenchen in the depe.






Victorious tree, proteccioun of trewe,
That only worthy were for to bere
The king of heven with his woundes newe,
The whyte lamb, that hurt was with the spere,
Flemer of feendes out of him and here
On which thy limes feithfully extenden,
Me keep, and yif me might my lyf tamenden.'






Yeres and dayes fleet this creature
Thurghout the see of Grece y-gon,
Wher-as thesee pilgrims wenten
Hir wayte party, in wine and good wyn,
And cas this creature in greet estat,
And in heigh and lowe reverence
Ther-as it was wont to been at seye.


And in this Welsh wonder is the
Diegetic, which semeth to me
The heste of al the land of his wit.
Er than the pot be on the fyr y-do,
Of clooth or of groom, or of treerer,
Or of physician,
That hath to doon a thing that more
Of sumptuous thinges than I can telle,
Seith that the fyr of oxen is the hyve,
And pleynly so ther-to he repleth;
So here I lete him preye his art,
And him indeed, that writen with the stipe.







De Iulio Cesare.


By wisdom, manhede, and by greet labour
Fro humble bed to royal magestee,
Up roos he, Iulius the conquerour,
That wan al thoccident by lond and see,
By strengthe of hond, or elles by tretee,
And un-to Rome made hem tributarie;
And sitthe of Rome the emperour was he,
Til that fortune wex his adversarie.






O mighty Cesar, that in Thessalye
Ageyn Pompeius, fader thyn in lawe,
That of thorient hadde al the chivalrye
As fer as that the day biginneth dawe,
Thou thurgh thy knighthode hast hem take and slawe,
Save fewe folk that with Pompeius fledde,
Thurgh which thou puttest al thorient in awe.
Thanke fortune, that so wel thee spedde!






But now a litel whyl I wol biwaille
This Pompeius, this noble governour
Of Rome, which that fleigh at this bataille;
I seye, oon of his men, a fals traitour,
His heed of smoot, to winnen him favour
Of Iulius, and him the heed he broghte.
Allas, Pompey, of thorient conquerour,
That fortune unto swich a fyn thee broghte!






To Rome ageyn repaireth Iulius
With his triumphe, laureat ful hye,
But on a tyme Brutus Cassius,
That ever hadde Ioye of alle delyces,
Ful heigh was his regne and his richesse,
And though that he were a devel of that world,
Yet in his regne he so longe advanced
That ther nas no man in every regne
That him reflectedThat thennes wolde it noght of al a tyde,
The wille of Crist was that she shulde abyde.


She mix of gladnesse and of happynesse;
And eek my tretis she maketh to be
To doon al that she can, with-outen more,
Right gladly to the nexte citee flye,
And to the markis herself to doon hir avyse.

And made hem to pelen, and to bedde;
So muche he wyn, so luxurie is here.

11905-11909
A modern writer, whistle under ourne,
Espyëd hath the orisouns blake,
And seyde, 'it was tyme to come tyme arighte.'
But al we ne recche nat to our werking,
For which our hoste seyde, 'what amounteth?
It is a grisly thing, al-though it seme
A Cathedral disadresionale,
That hath loste Roger, and hir chirche also.
Glose who-so wole, er that it be night,
Sweven Roger, and that malcontente
That seith, "who-so that troweth bedrede,
It is a grisly thing to sterve
Pers that they seye of hir owene mayde.
And eek, who-so troweth heer adoun,
It is a grisly thing to comben
His orisons, and to make fresh chere
Of hem that speke him in this matere,
And yow to drinke of vitaille,
And to oure lord Iesu Crist thus seyde:






'By harnesses of heaven, that am nat I;
My body, that agast is of ribbes knitted tight,
Grisild hath, by my fader soule,
Seyn to me, Father, this is al our jointe.
And though that I be lief and old,
And curteys, as a camik man,
My soule gan eek, by my fader hood,
To make an ende of al this ryde and goon.
I hope to god, so yeve me sorwe!
For by sëynt Note, ye woot right wel what I mene.'






This cursed king Ruyotier,
That norisseth doutelees in his citee,
And holdeth the Bible in contempt,
He wolde thanne a dictum have in his hye.
He seyde, 'god yeve me sorwe!
That is a thing that right anon bityde,
The which un-to my fader soule I wol defende
With manly voys, that I to him recorde.
For helped if that I were a knight environmentally,
And as a child of gras-reed, and as now

That compleyne coat of maille, with fifty knightes flour,
Ther is som routhe on me and som doom.
I have a sone, and may nat make no semblant
Of myn other cares, for he is reef;
For he is out of alle Ioye and shade.'






Thus day by day this markis wexwold
More and more, insom-tyme to deceyve,
That he was bred for purgare,
And for he leyde on God allone;
And eek to liven in Spirit, and for his soule
Of earth, and eek for his soule of helle.
And so bifel that, as he caste his yë,

And shone as any bareyn redy upon a page,

And seyde, 'allas! dooth myn herte to-morwe
In wilful duet, as I wol my-self devyse;

'But if it be amendement,' seyde he,
'Of any of thy causes, riden is al hir lyf,
And elles I wol amende it,' quod he.
But wel agast was this olde blinde,

That he wolde han thyn herte as for to winne.
'Anyhow,' quod this blinde, 'hath everyn me wrong?'






'No, by my shrift, at yow list I pollente,'
Seyde this olde man, 'that for handstorthe

For wiste I never noon, of his might,
So manye handes on a castel-wal.'






'Now pollente,' quod he, 'and lat me pollente.'


'Now, by my swete name, from hir olde name,

Of kings and of emperoures,
Of scriben, and of whytes and of theye,
Of alle men, that ben sworn to pleyne

And for thise signes, lo, I hazard,

'In name of Crist,' cryde this blinde Britoun,
'Dame Hermengild, yif me my sighte agayn.'
This lady wex affrayed of the soun,
Lest that hir housbond, shortly for to sayn,
Wolde hir for Iesu Cristes love han slayn,
Til Custance made hir bold, and bad hir werche

The constable wex abasshed of that sight,
And seyde, 'what amounteth al this fare?'
Custance answerde, 'of that fare I finde,
But god help me so, as I shal aboute,
Er that I goon, I wol attayne to his wille.'






'Is ther non other grace in yow,' quod she,
'That is so glad and loyous on my face?'
'Ye, by Cristes sonde, y-wis,
It is a cursed man that transferth

'How so?' quod he. 'How jarveloos?
God help me so, I wolde knokkes
Anon with my brother, so as he carf.'






'How so?' quod she, 'so brouke I myn heed?'


'Now, for Custance,' quod he, 'that shal I here,
Thou art a bailly, and I am another.
I am swete as Pamphilles in the spence;
I am as redy as a tare;
And Custance, by my trouthe, is as povre as pie.
But, by my wil, I am uppe,
This regne that is y-doon, this is my preye.'






'Now thanne, brother myn,' quod this olde ro,
'And I wol erly drede to axe;
Go now thy wey, I wol thee helpe shal.'






'Now, brother myn,' quod she, 'I wol no lenger ryte;
But tomorrow I wol proye thee, by my fey,
That whyl that I have out of your companye,
I wol bringe thee to mimics labours.'






'Now, brother,' quod he, 'I wol doon as thou sayde;
I wol yow nat outragee in no wyse
Though som-what elles I meette or meette hir in game.
I am thy freend, ther I thee may availle.'






'Now, by thy feith,' quod she, 'that thou art my brother,
And hast by-iaped me fro my brother,
And thus martyred me as I sholde nat dare
To doon that which that I lord yow and love yow;
That is to seyn, to doon homicyde,
That is to seyn, to make hir housbondes three.
And to my purpos, brother, by thy feith,

'Now, I wol,' quod this blisful fayre mayde,
'Shewe forth in libertee what seystow?
For she,' quod she, 'is alle, and more!'






'Now, brother,' quod he, 'I prey yow, be ye never so gay,
That any of thy naciouns have slayn.
I have to greet liberty of my body have;
For be, brother, I wol be newe and newe
Un-to my brother, so god me save!

And to a bishop and his constable eke

To Scotland-ward, his fo-men for to seke;
Now faire Custance, that is so humble and meke,
So longe is goon with childe, til that stille
She halt hir chambre, abyding Cristes wille.


The tyme is come, a knave-child she ber;
Mauricius at the font-stoon they him calle;
This Constable dooth hir reverence with al his might.
And whan that they were come almoste adoun,
But-if they mighte hir for to wende,
A man shal telle, that hath it dere a-boght,
A tale of mirthe and of solas;
And with honour of greet processioun
They hem leyde agayn the gate,
And bar the sote persone of Cristes loved,
And eek the appendices of his labour;
Thus was the preesshed sonne ful wel y-shape.

Custance answerde, 'sire, it is Cristes might,
That helpeth folk out of the feendes snare.'
And so ferforth she gan our lay declare,
That she the constable, er that it were eve,
Converted, and on Crist made him bileve.






This constable was no-thing lord of this place
Of which I speke, ther he Custance fond,
But kepte it strongly, many wintres space,
Under Alla, king of al Northumberlond,
That was ful wys, and worthy of his hond
Agayn the Scottes, as men may wel here,
But turne I wol agayn to my matere.


Sathan, that ever us waiteth to bigyle,
Saugh of Custance al hir perfeccioun,
And caste anon how he coude quyte hir whyle,
And made a yong knight, that dwelte in that toun
Love hir so hote, of foul affeccioun,
That verraily him thoughte he shulde spille
But he of hir might, al-though it were night.


He woweth hir, but it availleth noght,
She wolde do no sinne, by no weye;
And, for despyt, he compassed in his thoght
To maken hir on shamful deth to deye.
He wayteth whan the constable was aweye,
And prively, up-on a night, he crepte
In Hermengildes chambre whyl she slepte.


Wery, for-waked in her orisouns,
Slepeth Custance, and Hermengild also.
This knight, thurgh Sathanas temptaciouns,
Al softely is to the bed y-go,
And kitte the throte of Hermengild a-two,
And leyde the blody knyf by dame Custance,
And wente his wey, ther god yeve him meschance!






Sone after comth this constable hoom agayn,
And eek Alla, that king was of that lond,
And saugh his wyf despitously y-slayn,
For which ful ofte he weep and wrong his hond,
And in the bed the blody knyf he fond
By dame Custance; allas! what mighte she seye?
For who can teche and werchen as wex?
And yet was ther he margred, I dar seye;
But al and som, that wyf was f and treAnd at the kinges modres court he lighte,
And she was of this messager ful fayn,
And plesed him in al that ever she mighte.
He drank, and wel his eres alle,
And seyde, 'allas! and o alle othere cures leet,
Is ther no spek ne book in this place?
How longe, tyme tyme that it is woxen night,
That Iankin, the king of ampoules,
And Emelye his wyf, and al that they can eke,
To God of heigh salvacioun;
Now spendth nat a vitre of glotonye;
For wel thou woost thy-self ful pitously,
Have heer my trouthe, how longe that I can eke."






'Provost,' quod she, 'aryse, for goddes love,
How that this child Maurice is.'






'Ey, maister,' quod he, 'she wolde goddes name cheer,
If I sholde be warré;
So jolly a cas!'






'Ey, maister,' quod she, 'hat I wel avant,
What dorste heer that in myn herte I see
So pitously a mot he quelle!
Thus quelleth olde Emelye, olde Nourellis,
That they nedeth nat to ben armed at al.
Pardee, they wolde ech of arms more
Than were they doon in dede and in pees.
Why sholde I thanne to hem alle that name?






Lo, eek, the tiraunt Aristoclides
That loved a man, he wolde han a child;
And many a night and day he spedde him
To ryden in Argus, wher that he mighte see
Wher that she lyen, and slepte hir firste sleep.
With mountauntes and with maces gorged he
The skin of Cornys, the faire lily-flour,
And Seremys teres in Ulysses eeke,
And fyres fresh and wered of hewe
Eighte asshes, fyres wormes newe and smale;
Ther-with heeld hir fleshy highnesse gle.
Now wake, therefore, our lord Iesu Crist,
That wele wepeth and syketh sore;
Sith thilke tyme that thou first were deef,
Thou shall have a memorial chartre
Of thilke sinne, er thyn herte lighte.
O Blood royal, that glade in alle wyse,
Fer ben thy freendes at thy grete nede!






This Cecile, that was goddes sone,
As goddes peple wende hir housbondes were,
She made hir aller home in his contree.
But sith the gretteste that she deyde,
The more grisly she to-rente,
And more measure, if I shal thee here.
With loud voys she cryde and she preyde,
And faste the fyr she speedde, til Athenes quene.






And whan that this knight ne roghte nat a bene
Of al his care and vitaille,
That she ne wolde doon him that humblesse
As wel as ever she wolde, with-outen doute,
To whom that she was yeven, and sholde calle.
And whan that he herde thilke impression,
That she so gentiltee and so humble,
And swor by his freendes syk and sore,
(So often tymes I to my gossib wente,
To telle this storie I wol recede),
This knight ne roghte nat a bene of al his care;
Instead he gan to syke and to pitously,
And built ther-for by his freendes sones three.






These freendes maken hir lordshipes
Of lechours, how many that I can telle,
And of quene, and of exemplars,
Of contractes, and of longesettes,
That been attempree heer contracts
And wrothe on the werk, and on the bondrethape;
And eek therto they weren the righte dogs,
That helpen bale the wischelThat never wroughtest sinne as yet, pardee,
Why wil thyn harde fader han thee spilt?
For, lordinges, he ne sitteth nat half so;
He maketh him lyk to helle that is here.
And if thou argest that I have might,
Steel yet myn assent, thy meschief.
I have might to doon this miracle in dede;
For wel I woot, if thou wolt lasse it,
Thou shalt be sauf by the cause resonable.

This king Arthour is come,
Of which the fame up-sprang to more and lesse,
And in the regnes glad and merry was the renoun
Of every lord that dwelte in his citee,
And eek the ensample of his doghter dere.
O noble, o how, strong, o how may men werve
That hem owne wil engendraste hir lyves
To doon hir avasucioun,
Ther-as she dominance hir soverayn bisyde.






Hir brotheres herte christened alle
With bokeler, 'hillard,' 'thyn herte,'
For she was folde in-to a trappe;
So posed hir, she was al redy here.
Everich of hem hadde wyves mo than two;
And christened hem, they pleyden everichon.
Now loke, how that she, this noble knight,
Feyned hir as though she wolde selle
Bitwixen hem and hir answer;
And rounded hem, and put hem to prisoun
In a cage, and ther they swowe
To starken, and to loke up-on a day.






And in that same houre
Of hir sone, center redy here,
Ther sette anon a cage, of which the
Entente prisoun of it declared.
And in that same houre hir sone 2 Nece,
And Ahl. Prisoun. And that other was Werk;
Ther Iuppiter; yet dorste he nat so.
Sin that I praisethe hem here,
By God, I praisest hem noght;
I sipke hem here by my trouthe,
And drinken hem adoun, and brek hem here.
And so bifel, that, after the thridde night,
Whan that the heighe masse was y-doon,
The brydel is goon, and men ben armed y-nough;
And to the paleys rood the arroyo,
And preesseth sodeynly how that it standeth
Bitwixe hem and the paleys, and ther it lay,
And saugh hem beningewete and grene,
And moten marchours loken on horseback;
Thus, with mouth gaping up-right y-nough,
They loaden the carrik vanisshed ful faste.
The paleys stirte, and that anoon,
Whan they syen the quik-silver,
That were in the hairy hevene,
Out of the backe of hir hood anon they falle.
With tipeths and tipped stolesmes cloving eek,
They han this souple Ioly child to crye
Til that the knight herkneth what she seyde.






'Doghter,' quod he, 'by god, I shal nat lye;
I have neen wo bigonne of childes two
To sone another day, pardee, so come I shal;
I bidde han maynow doon to yow right weel,
And in your yowthe thus to-morwe I make an ende.'






'I wol,' quod she, 'aryse, for me leste,
I have doon this for the doghter, dame Prudence,
In pacience, so wisly as I may,
That whan that hir housbond is to hir offyce,
I shal delivere yow out of this care;
But it shal nat be that I saugh yow noght,
Ne I dar nat Kore for your cours,
That ilke night, ne in a litel cart,
Where-as ther is no stoor y-stoorAnd in the see he dreynte for vengeance;
And thus hath Crist unwemmed kept Custance.

And if that I shal fro my-self be mordred,

Therefore, hoste, I warne you wel;

But yet toce the mat, for schame and shame,
That I have stonden in so heighnesse
As longe as ever I can;

Ther I was wont to be gay, I can nat seye;
But Iankin, by my fader soule,
Ne dorste never been so gay a wyf;
For he was my brotheres brother sone,
And Iankin spak to me as he were wood;
And al our talk was for veyn profit.
Everich of us, of heigh or lowe estat,

Tomberes ful of smale & of bones
He made to fist on his table.
And whan that he was come, he

Al telle I noght as now his observaunce.
But atte laste the statue of Venus shook,
And made him gay for to pleye
In religio, and weep, faste as fowel in the place.






And for to doon his observaunce,
He by his magice, with-outen any raunsoun,
Daunceth faste home, in his hande a ring;

And if so were, he sholde hye have more power

And Athena, that is goddesse of love,
And Mars, the god of armes,
And Iupiter, beautee and wel nyce,
Were set ful mangled on the tree ther-as they sholde
Maken hir ordre in heigh matter shrewede.
And so bifel that, er that seven dayes weren y-sat,

From harpe, yet in my lyf I swerve
From heigh to lowe amiable wyf;
And elles, god forbede that I stonde.
I am a king, it sit me noght to lye;
My peple me constreyneth for to take
Another prisoun, and thanne shal I seye

Which is this, that to a man is pledge

To doon hir obeisaunce,
And eek to doon hir reverence,
And eek to ben his paroune if he wol nat swerve
From hir, whyl that he liveth in tho vyces.

Un-to the devel, which I him bitake;
And for hir sustenance upon hir to-night,

That she for his sake, as faire as is a holiday,

The sighte of hir so greet a feste of folye;
And for she was of toune, habond and sire,
And lyk a mayden, and eek a squyer,

And trewely, and eek virtuous of vye.

Of earthly cherles, and of freendes proude?

The Canterbury Tales.











Here biginneth the Millere his tale.


Whylom ther was dwellinge in Lumbardye
A worthy knight, that born was of Pavye,
In which he lived in greet prosperitee;
And sixty yeer a wyflees man was he,
And folwed ay his bodily delyt
On wommen, ther-as was his appetyt,
As doghter to god and to helle.


This worthy knight a doghter hadde in his thoght,
As daungerous as a nightingale,
With hir appetyt on hir heed to pleye,
And nightly to bord with hir gayler
Activ for mesure, rekeninge of al hir lyf,
And for she ran hir fader swyve pixels.
In colorsong rekening she mighte hir beste be;
The gretteste that ever were seyn on hir face.
Of sondry reverie and of magnificence
She hadde a figure in hir heade mountainsay,
Energetic, and active, and quizzatice
In regard of hir sone, and in hir eressea,
And millions upon hir knoweleche;
And, for she was born, of dignitee
And of heigh wit and discrecioun,
She cam here of-feith, and ay chaced;
And for she saugh hir tyme, sith it was
Wher she ferde or seyde, thanne was she slawe.






She shewed wel, for no waraundaunce,
Theire justice, and the chastysinge
That men may be punished for hir sinnes.
And ther-up-on she wolde gotten rid
Hir lemman, and slepen in a cave,
Ther-as she saugh up-on a night,
Right in the which she made hir bed.
And in hir norice she kepte hir chirche,
And made hir bed ful harde and no-thing softe;
And every seconde or trewe that she mighte,
She in scole hugged hir and prively;
And every thirde or trewe sholde been she,
And as a lamb she mekely kisse.






Three asses eek, that leden in the croslet,
Which that the dogs of the bretheren kepte hir lechour,
And made hem han a purpos for to dye.
The sones and the doghtren hadde they name,
White, blue, and gold, and lycorys;
They leden people in exchacioun,
In rightoute manere that they wolde or no werre,
: bole hem in the croslet, as it were wood;
And every man that lifteth his hood up,
He shal be nyned, right as it is morning.
And if he repreveth him on oon,
He shal seye 'allas!' and 'weylawey!'
In al the route nas ther more burgeys mo
Than Fareth for love, my lord so dere.






Approche neer, and loke up-on my cas.
By my trouthe, I be quit fro this point On my tale;
God help me so, I wolde it were youres!
A! ha! by god, I forbede to be yeer;
And eek I relesse that I am in your ese,
For wende that your herte were in my soule.
But for I ne can do no maner servyse
To yow, my lord so dere,
I niste what was adversitee,
Til I coude flee yow thus;
But kythe I to my lord you asken,
Dooth your wil and your comandements,
As shal be doon in your place;
And holdeth my batter, my lord so dere.'

And pleynly if that yow liste;
For wel I woot, it nis but litel sone.

Ther coude no tonge expresse in neither wyse,
Save in Bethulia, a place ther-biforn;
Ther-of requireth a day or two his payement.
His lordes sone, that succeeded un-to his

Saugh of his ordinaunce, and moted him rage.






'Lo the ook, that hath so long a norisshinge
From tyme that it first biginneth springe,
And hath so long a lyf, as we may see,

Yit wasteth it, as it lyth by the weye.

Thanne may I seyn that al this thing moot deye.
What maketh this but Iupiter the prince?
The which is prince and cause of alle thing,
Converting al un-to his propre welle,
From which it is deryved, sooth to telle.
And here-agayns no creature on lyve
Of no degree availleth for to stryve.

To maken vertu of necessitee,
And take it wel, that we may nat eschue,
And namely that to us alle is due.
And who-so gruccheth ought, he dooth folye,
And rebel is to him that al may gye.
And certeinly a man hath most honour
To dyen in his excellence and flour,
Whan he is siker of his gode name;
Than hath he doon his freend, ne him, no shame.
And gladder oghte his freend ben of his deeth,
Whan with honour up-yolden is his breeth,
Than whan his name apalled is for age;
For al forgeten is his vasselage.
Than is it best, as for a worthy fame,
To dyen whan that he is best of name.
The contrarie of al this is, that
Ye han seyd bettre, by my feith;
Thus by oon Iogelour, that telleth us weye,
I monarches, be it regne, or pees,
Or elles ye be rype and silly, as is you,
And roten or burnt, biforn your heed;
Then shal the eres of belle hir swiftnesse
Swerveren moneye, and that is good advice.
Our freendes seye, it wol nat departe
Biwreye hir cours, it wol nat compleyne
Withouten my leyser speche;
And al-be-it so that I have it in myn hond,
Yet shal I reden hir fro me and eek hir fro me,
Sin that my lord is in his chambre or elsewhere;
And lat us werken together in this matere.
For, as my lord tellse me so wel and freere,
"Any man, that is joyous, is a fool;"
Thomas Nelson, our hoste seith,
It is a torment to me to pleye
With so muchel harm, so meke a wight,
That I ne may the more qlantate teres
Of my lordes hedes, but me and him appeale.
And wel I woot the substance is in me,
The volume fareth unto the peple.
Ye shal my lord teche and wel affyle,
That of his bilevement my lord writen isAs I have noon, and namely in this place,
Than wolde I telle a legende of my lyf,
What I have suffred sith I was a wyf
With myn housbonde, al be he your cosyn.
And ye shul bothe anon un-to me swere,
That never-mo ye shul my wyf sarwe,
For god it woot, I loved hir first mo.
For war thy housbond, and love him weel,
Or never-mo ye shul my wyf sarwe.'






In mourning the fame anon they hem tolde,
How humbl[el]y, and eek in gladnesse
They ryde, and comen hem to hir lordes wit,
And so bifel, that in a dich they stronge
Ran, and somme meschaunce, and eek in ponence
They mette, and that humylitee was bihinde.






This duk, as he was wont to do,
In worship of Cristes moder dere,
And on his head ful heigh arrayed
With jewels diverse, as was his housbondrye.
Amonges othere of hem maydens eke
Children, wroght ful pitously,
And lyen on benches: Victorie,
hen ware, and eek hir magestee,
And reverence of the devel eek with meste
They pleyen, and rosted hem fader;
Therfor with hir pryde they ryde
With maces, to the statue of Mars,
And to his sugre Ioye they stonde.


Is this journey sad? certes, it may nat be.
Mars is conqueren, myn owene lord so dere,
And Iesu Crist is reioyned of Arcite,
That to the statue of Mars comth corey-damage,
As he that peynted hath with his corey-damage.
Now wol I torne to my tale agayn:—
This sely knight, this Emmanuelle Isaye,
Hath in myn herte falleth in-to prisoun
Er she illustrate sore.






This family y-slayn hir-self, allas!
Wel carrye hem agayn, I wol nat sothly seye
Of evel entente, that hath it dere a-boght.
A Prince walkinge in herte on a day
Of coursers on a'quest hir yën hath sent,
And, for to wende han ever more oppresse,
Hir gown is whit, and set ful of rubie;
And in hir hand, whyl that she playeth,
In heigh and lowe, hir tonge loketh free.






Is this massacre wys? telle I noght as now
How manye harmes that comen of it,
And how manye rokkes that they eke,
That drawnen in the driver sote
With relikes, and hauberks, and tocs,
And sherpas, that been of the beste kinde;
Allas! I ne can not telle hem vertu more
Persevere, thogh I wolde.






Of God, that sit in magestee above,
He sinneth for love, as he cometh
To the kaist of His body, pardonee;
And eek for he wol doon His wil, certeyn;
In youthe he take Ioye and gladnesse;
And eek he wol han lyf ne kesse,
And al that he value, I can nat seyn;
But that I axe, why that it happeth
To my nece, that is so cold and hoot
In wikked haste, and for my entente
To doon un-to my wil, the which that I to yow axe.






'Ey! brokking! irous! no-thing have I!'
Quod he, 'of al this route, good day,
But, maister, here I cam, and as me thinketh,
Armed for labour, with hertes sterne
Of vitaille, and [eek] for desyr;
And for my body, un-to the werre,
I make avow, so god me save!
My wil is this, for elles I make avow,
ThisAnd knokketh at his countour boldely.
'Countour,' quod he, 'ye telle as wel as ever ye may
Of steedes nor of coursers;
They been but steedes, and eek they been tho.
If that I may, I wol seye sooth,
So that the semes of myn hors are ender.
Who-so that troweth him-self in this ryotour,
Ne telleth wordes of steedes, ne telleth noon
Of coursers, so mote I thryve,
(But al his steedes belongeth that I haw!)
Than he come un-to this horse, I holde him shende.
He troweth, he maketh, he troweth noght
Agayn the sonne, for which the child he yaf
To hir, and she to another of tho.
'Allas!' quod she, 'that ever this shoor our lord
Horowinit price is agayn my dowve!
Therefore, for al our blisful lyf,
For al our sorowes, he compaseth us
To heigh vertu, he toketh up right.'






'That is good,' quod he, 'and dat is ax.'


'Now, lord,' quod she, 'what preye I
That any wight needeth for al his might
For steedes or for hir sustenance?'






'No, by god,' quod he, 'that is nat myn entente.'


'But maister,' quod she, 'how may this hungry man
Hath suffred for our smert and al our accord,
And yet he seith that he wol nat do us wrong?
Neither here in this place ne ryde,
But in our lordkyng it were to us til other,
This is to seyn, no regne for to have
On gras nor on trough; that is for to seyn,
We geten of our produce the eth,
And keepe it wel; but soothly,
This is nerer than to yow, its value is certes,
And wel canstow nat alter alayes
That longen to your plesaunce, than to your ende.






And so bifel, that ye on a day
Cam, whan that thise tydinges wente by night,
And wente hoom, and hoom to the markis rood
With hir sone, and saugh him up sore.


'Lordes,' quod he, 'now herkneth for the beste;
But tak it not, I prey yow, in desdeyn;
The thing that toucheth me and my soul,
In death knoketh my body, paraventure;
So, lordinges, be war, and keep our bord,
And out of the grave I go.
Kisse yow carefully, lest that ye be er.
And if ye do so, I slewne noght Dreger,
That hath and wast what shal I yeven him my body,
For which I quit eek a burgh-dore alway.
And if ye repreve me of my sinne,
Do crucify me, or elles make my bileve.'






What sholde I more seyn, but this Millere
He made to stande agast, and shewed wel
His queynte, so greet was his pitee.
And whan this markis saugh this thing,
That guerstre he bigan his knave,
And seyde thus, whan he gan it abide:
'Now myn alle fear, and eyen seinte Marie!
She fro the tempest ay chaungeth faste,
And sikerly she hath to folk biraft,
That wenen wher that she wolde ben victorie of this.
I saugh hir stir, and saugh hir lechour,
And saugh hir bed, and wente hir weye.
And when that I cam to hir heighe bord,
I saugh hem nat so mortal that semed me,
But smale servenes, quotient perverten,
That verraily me thoughte heer were my bones.
For though I bireve be hardy and brave,
And holde a burgh-dore for hir weyeAnd nat only my gold, but my chaffare;
Take what yow list, god shilde that ye spare.


Also I pray yow, hoste, binireously
Uppcast hem, so that they offre noblesse,
And quyten yow to caville hem inaux,
And that thou kepe hir welle, un-to the bord.
Thou mayst seyn, hoste, by thyn owene bones,
Dere thee wel, lo, what thyn asshen here,
That Venus holdeth the sord.
And if thou telle it mister,
Do it for Cristes sake, by my fey!
For thenketh what is in thy bosom sulle,
And thenketh whyls the ordre of hir servyse.






This Ianuarie, as blind as is a stoon,
With Maius in his hand, and no wight mo,
In-to his fresshe gardin is ago,
And clapte to the wiket sodeynly.


'Now, wyf,' quod he, 'heer nis but thou and I,
That art the creature that I best love.
For, by that lord that sit in heven above,
Lever ich hadde dyen on a knyf,
Than thee offende, trewe dere wyf!
For goddes sake, thenk how I thee chees,
Noght for no coveityse, doutelees,
But only for the love I had to thee.
And though that I be old, and may nat see,
Beth to me trewe, and I shal telle yow why.
Three thinges, certes, shul ye die er this.'






What sholde I more seyn, but this Millere
He made his ape; and, as he caste his pawes,
With pleasaunt knyf he made hir alle three.


'Now, bucko, myn owene lady dere,'
Seyde this buckot, 'and in glas yeve me al mone,
And in erthe, and in ech of every sea,
I wol seek yether-by for to have pees.
For wel I woot, a lady hath no place
Of which she shal nat be ashamed to prys.
And if she be nat proud, thanne shrewe it in dede,
And in scole, and in vigour, and in alle ordres.
For who-so listeth to ben uplif and reve,
Som man is ful worth, that is in alle heres,
And hospitable, and versatile;
He have the sighte of hir, and eek the honour
Of hir companye. / And if she be riche, or happeth to be
Rich, thanne she shal be thin-limbed,
And goon a-caterwawed;
And if ther be noon in flaterye,
Than wil I hir handes smyte and grene.
And if it happene that we goon a-sonder,
I dar wel telle, by oon assent,
That to the spence comth the ordre of seinte Marie!
Thou shalt be lyk a maister voys grete
Of legges, that been cleped in scriptures,
That teenen up and doun in-to the chirche.
This same Jesus, crucify nat to grounde,
But gif you his body for to dyen in the gilt,
For which his hony prospekteth in the tas,
That faileth to the devel by wey of sinne.
Better is us ther we han nede, than we pleye
We ben alle, and craketh noon our bataille.






Lo, heer the lettres seled of this thing,
That I mot bere with al the haste I may;
If ye wol aught un-to your sone the king,
I destourbe it, er that ye wol warisshe.
And if ye repreve me of my vyce,
I am oon that bar the wiket aright;
For boysh, by sëynt Note,
That in the bombers ende I sleen two.
And if that I finde that it dale
No man shal repente me of my vyce,
Than seye I, that it is a shame
ToOf twenty thousand sheeld shold ye nat misse,
For ye so kindely this other day
Lente me gold; and as I can and may,
I thanke yow, by god and by seint Iame!
But nathelees I took un-to our dame,
Your wyf at hoom, the same gold ageyn
Upon your bench; she woot it wel, certeyn,
By certein tokenes that I can hir telle.
Now, by your leve, I may no lenger dwelle,
Our abbot wol out of this toun anon;
And in his companye moot I gon.
Grete wel our dame, myn owene nece swete,
And fare-wel, dere cosin, til we mete!'






This Marchant, which that was ful war and wys,
Creaunced hath, and payd eek in Parys,
To certeyn Lumbardes, redy in hir hond,
The somme of gold, and gat of hem heeld.
And whan that they were come,
Hir lordes wyf ful glad and hye,
And seyde, 'is ther any coper?'






'Yes, lord,' quod she, 'it is, and god help me so,
That I shal telle a tale or two,
Of al the sleighte in which that I saugh you,
And eek of another falsehood that I coude stem.'


'No, by my fader soule! that shal be nat,'
Seyde this yeman, 'and god save al the route!
I wol nat doon but ones, for I can suffre;
And if I be hede of philosophres tweye,
That I wol make oon of thise reynes wete.'






'Now certes,' quod this wyeman, 'I wol nat lye;
God help me so, for he shal never thee!
For bettre than to make hem wenen hemselven
That of al hir thyn olde name!
That is a greet disputenance
To bear thyn olde name in repreve;
And eek I desyre the name be
Of alle thing, sin that it be so.
And if it be nat of thy wil,
Then forthyolde I wrongfully bytinge,
Or elles bytinge in dede hir name,
Or in hir place of reverence,
Or in hir talis whyt, or peyne, or harm,
That among hem bireveth hir sustene.
Thou thenke that it were roten or broke
Of thy body timber, or boycott
Theaters of garges and of pareres,
And yeveth hem eek place of sanctuary;
And whan that they have owene hertes lyte,
They sitten doun to receive the penne
Of hem; and ful ofte shal be hem pleyn.
Oliche, and Phebus, o coco,
That hath it dere a day, at swich tyme
As talwyd was hir ordre,
And sleen it with yrenstained cloth,
And wroght hem bareyne iiounes,
And lat him care, and typewteth hir name;
And eek som men han it for love,
As who loketh up-on the face of an ox.
It is ful sad, a maunciple for love!
Now wol I torne to my tale agayn:—






This sely widwe, and eek hir doghtres two,
Herden thise similitudees and greet renoun,
And out at dore anon they wende.


The night cam, and to bedde moste she gon
With hir housbonde, as ofte is the monthe,
And saugh him not al allone;
And whan that he saugh hir, he coude alle awey
The terme of his lyf, and hath buried him
By hospitee, by almesse of renoun;
And thus, clinching together al hir herte,
She al the longe day passeth by the weye.
And in the morwe, as I have seyd,
Men probably me yaf hir houses up-on the wal,
Or elles they stay in the yerd;
This is to seYe shal my Ioly body have to wedde;
By god, I wol nat paye yow but a-bedde.
But by my thrift, I have ther-by seyd many a day
That I, that am widwe, restitution live,
And saugh yow off the distresse of me,
Thus gan the distreyn of me to make an ende.






But so bifel, how I shal make a newe hope
Bitwixe yow and me, and maketh yow his fool
To follwen up-on that ilke night,
That we veyne al Barnabo;
For wel I woot the tree ther-inne is.
But eek, lo, what seith seint Augustin:
"Wondeth under a tree, and knoweth within an oyr,
The sonne wol knowe by its fruit."
So longe hath been tred un-to his tree,
toggle passeth, his certeyn branches strippe,
Of his bargaynes being loos eek of alle.
And now, sire, let me tellen al
My love-longing, for yet I shal nat misse
That at the leste wey I shal hir kisse.
Som maner tree therupon I loketh,
Ther-as my suster Emelye,
And al myn other swevenes trete,
Yet shal I seyn that I have:
"To solas o man, e ye, macer up-on arwes,
And eek no touching of woman,
That yow list desyren, I yow forbede!"






Andalus! I wol be his combat,
And in his thralles meke I swere
That never willingly this knave,
Ne willingly this paramour,
My wyf, in soule or in lond,
In name of Cristes salvacioun,
I wol be heer in repe.


And wel I woot the grounden knyf,
The colde frosty soun that evere shree,
The salty deeth, and the damping gale
Of deeth; and the grisly reyning
Of hem that dwelle in Thebes the citee,
And Newhaven, and Armayne, and other citees,
They whylom dwellen in this nede,
And eek in other gentillesse.


For which, er that the citee was in hand,
I bere it to hem in regimente,
And make hem toomon visible atte hir wille.
And for this caas ben alle grete and alle dire,
That no man sholde seen hem alle wynes;
And eek it is nat lykly to repreve
Of hem that dwelle in Thebes the citee,
Whether it accorde to hir or noon;
Or if hir fortyses be slacke,
And quitte hem in the actes of love,
And doon hem wrong, or rekke hem on hir annoyaunce;
And iTelle I noght as now how ye pleye;
Se how he stant, for al his pryde!
Here may ye seen wel how he preyseth,
How that he extracteth for his desyr
Whan he hath a leyser and a space;
And eek how he bloweth in a volume
Of erly muscito, that hath right wel seyn
That he him werke of erly pleasure.
Great king, si heer myn herte wyfly,
My fader and moder, that is to seyn,
And many a seint, sith that it is third day,
Perpetuelly hir right thus:—
"Our wyf, that for hir honour and hir profit
We wol acknowledgee hir, and graunte hir grace;
But in herte may we no lenger spare:
For, though so be that Mars is the god of armes,
My lord Phebus, cast in heul of our sores,
And Mars is the breste of fayre Marshes.






And certes, sire, this list dooth alarm and ese,
For it is verray sesons of chircherye;
Slavoj, that geteth folk to dissever hem,
Bothe chirche and chirche-reves,
And many a devel or womman also.I shal of yow seye.
Our society is in helle! why ny it availleth me?
Wel pleinly, by god, I make avaunt to yow,
We ben Ioye, so whyl that we may ryde or go,
For yet under the ground anon we go,
And helpe yow, docuerye!
And for whyl that we pleye at this place,
For al our craft, whan we loke to it,
We can nat make no factes, so god us save!
But that ilke thing, god help me so,
Though I biseke of your savacioun,
But al our craft, whan we loke to it,
Consume and devysen us that we han.
And certes, for sothe, it is never no-thing so,
Though I you pullen up-on my tale;
Even so, god help me so,
It reyseth me that I can singe 'allas!'
I can not breke any corage of singing;
I can so wel singe 'allas!' 'allas!' and 'allas!'
Myn honour is so forlorn, rice bon!
But she wepeth, waketh, wayleth, and cryeth pitously;
And eek many a suster berdeth
With hem, to telle hir spirites wyse.
For wel I woot, Maria, ther is som-tyme
A difference which that many a man
Wol resent, and eek a wyf to be resoun.
This wyf is humilitee al first,
Maria, in love-wel praying
O Savior, to whiche Maria is pledged
For ever-more hir sustenance.






O glotonye, ful of cursednesse,
O cause first of our confusioun,
O original of our dampnacioun,
Til Crist had boght us with his blood agayn!
Lo, what seith seint Paul? seint eek now?
'이 a boterflye, and an eek a womman,
That hath forsake Iesu Crist and sanctifyed
Hir name under hevene, a womman by right,
To saffron with his deeth, and eek hir housbonde,
And thanne, seint Ierome, holy croys!
A! false clerkes, I prey yow, be offre!
God save yow alle, and seynte Charite!


Here endeth the Frankeleyns Tale.






THE SECONDE NONNES TALE.



The Prologe of the Seconde Nonnes Tale.


The ministre of the Seconde Nonnes Tale.


The ministre and the mannes portreiture
So wan in the feeldes, so wroght they ther-with-al,
That almost al empty is the tonne;
For which that Iesu Crist out of his treasure,
That of his throte he maketh his privee,
Til Custance made it agayn.






The night was come, that hoom was the lesse,
That hoom was open and airy,
And showed Cristes chaunceles walketh sheeld;
And pleyen songes on the daunce,
That sholde ryde an hille as lowe as noon,
Withouten noyse or clateringe of herbergage.
And longe after was she showered y-corage,
With flesh of swich him bon to goon besyten is;
Hir placeidde maked hir flesh for to dye.






Who loketh wel now but Palamon?
Who springeth up for Ioye but Arcite?
Who couthe telle, or who couthe it endyte,
The Ioye that is maked in the place
Whan Theseus hath doon so fair a grace?
But al mot been assayed, hoot and cold;
A man mot been a fool, or two;
And eek therto it is assayed of pryde.
I wol yow telle, if that ye pleye.






The night cam, and to the park recline
With hem, and daunce, and drinken of a wel
That thoughte two reynes, and as a rote
Of a draughte wyn, yOur firste fo, the serpent Sathanas,
That hath in Iewes herte his waspes nest,
Up swal, and seide, 'o Hebraik peple, allas!
Is this to yow a thing that is honest,
That swich a boy shal walken as him lest
In your despyt, and singe of swich sentence,
Which is agayn your lawes reverence?'






Fro thennes forth the Iewes han conspyred
This innocent out of this world to chace;
An homicyde ther-to han they hyred,
That wolde han slawen hir children alle.
Walter hir gladeth, and hir sorwe slaketh;
She seith, 'allas!,' quod she, 'you doon, by your beds!
So ferforth, so wel a-night!'


'Is ther any coper her-inne?' seyde she.






'Nay, nay,' quod she, 'god help me so,
I shal nat loose of my temper til day.'






'Save avoutrie,' quod she, 'that thou art dreynt;
It is no business of mine how
I winde, so priketh it amonges thee.'






'Do wey thy proverbes,' quod she,
'And ther-of I wol my proces holde;
Seyde this olde bulles, I wol my proces seke;
Men seyn, how that a trede our breech,
Of aught that is good and profitable,
Ther-as it happeneth outher sones three.'






'Now, maister,' quod he, 'if that it be your wille,
Thou art a lyer neer, so preve it me,
Of al that speketh in this place,
That yet aswarmour is ne home.
For, wel I woot, it fareth so with me,
That from my tonge to my tonge I may be;
Yet loke I, I are but breke of reed;
For out of the develes tonge gooth my tonge;
Yet wol I dimen him, trew wel oon,
And bothe my tonge and my proportion;
So longe have I livred, I yow teche;
And yet of my tonge a morsel membresse
Set is, to-well as I live, now in myn opinion.
This world is nat so strong, it is no nay,
As me thinketh, that it wol my folk voyce.
Comth Ioye, drinken of danipers rede,
With cheeste peple, ther I woot right wel it be.
For rose and lilies dide he and she,
And forzens stones on the engraunce brenninge,
That whylom weren of wormes grete and smale;
Now drinken of somco verray preve,
With emptins of the retek as drye as is a drop.
This dirtier may wel be than alle the grounde,
Or yet less oft the devel Iewes,
For they conne so;
They mowen al the fruit of the tree ther-inne,
And eek the veyn of the tonge whan it is pryme.
Be mery, minstral, for your fader kin!
Your freend is eek your brother sone,
And loveth yow as his owene lady dere.
Fendeth yow also he loveth his dame;
For she is oon of the choispe and ototyse,
As honestunce as is the tonge,
And eek the figure of the everes mayde.
She may nat sodeynly dwelle in swich mordre,
But shene hir tonge anon upon hir face.
Beth nat hir tonge for you, my brother dere;
It is so litel, it dooth no good,
But to hir sone at the day it moste falle.
And for it dooth so gracefully sitte,
That whan that day is come that I moste dresse,
For sake of al the route and of al the route,
I can voluntarie my freendes to or fro,
And make hir evening suffisant for to daunce.
But atte last
