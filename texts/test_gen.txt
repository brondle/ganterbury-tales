test a wey,
But al that she knoweth is guer by rote.
Guer is it than a day or two,
That she ne shal lette of swich matere;
And eek it may be wel with hir wyf,
As for to han children, and eek for to indulge
In amorous passion, god help me so.
O flesh they been, and eek as yet nyce,
Hir to disporte and hir to helle!
Yet tikled it his herte, as ech of hem pleye.
They ne wene of hir noyse noght,
Ne wene of noyse no displese,
But satte at his windowe or at his beddes syde.
He cleped them to his service, To worshipe him on mount Emelye,
And leyde hir lemman, and to-work they come;
But never wher they wenten of hir knowe.






This Martin, as blind as is a stoon,
With dyvers Cleer, and oon Richard,
In listesomon, to serve and plese,
And lete hir listes maistresse up and doun
Of service and of plythes grete and smale;
Thus ended is this Martin and this Richard,
In sondry ordre, as I have seyd.



1191-1196. Cp. Pt. Ln. omit six lines.    1192. Cm. Iye; E. Hn. eye.



Tho redde they hir listes maistresse, and alle hir wyves,
And whyle they were in heighnesse,
And eek of hir moneye, and ther-to good;
And sente hem word by lettres, with-outen any haste,
To come to diner, as I shal yow devyse.






This passeth forth; what wol ye bet than wel?
Tho redde they, as sone as it was day,
Of sondry folk, and seyde, how that they seyde
Soothly, what that they wroghten on this motyf?
Thus wasendel in his langage,
To telle yow al the condicioun
Of ech of hem, soothly to telle.






By whiche means, soothly for to seyn,
God hath suffred this tribulacioun
In tribulacioun of testaments,
And suffred it in-to profitablement;
For certes, gold in toun is,
And to this ech of hem it is ayre
To doon plesaunce, so as beste his day.
And so bifel, that, er that noon was day,
Persones vs. cateliers sayde,
That men moten three levels of defences;
That is to seyn, against what harm that is doon.
AL-be-it so that no man finden shal
Noon in this world that trotteth hir weye,
Ne man ne beest, swich as men coude devyse;
But in progessaunce it lacrimeth so,
That knowingly sheweth fals his art.
And therfore, for Cristes sake, every man,
Do sende his wey to prove by herte
That he wol doon, er that he ferth al his lyf.
For litel gold is in preyeres,
And, if that a man be hende, and come of gentil blood,
Shal make a gerland for his lanterne,
And in the gardin ryde an hauberk,
And in the same gardin, driving a prisoun,
And in the manere, Emelye,
With fyr in honde, as biforn.
And in the gardin, further back than pryme,
Of al this, Rory and Macrobie,
They make pees how that he shake the place;
And in the place they finde, more than I can telle,
The dere wyf, with broken armes two,
Hir bridal-cere and hir sonne heeld him faste,
And seyde, 'allas! o tendre creature!
Now sir, at erst offrryve wey!
Thou art a matere, ther is na-more to se
